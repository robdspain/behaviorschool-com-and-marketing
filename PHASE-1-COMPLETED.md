- `/age-appropriate-act-metaphors`
- `/act-implementation-challenges-solutions`
- `/act-matrix-schools-hub`

### Solution
1. **Moved HTML files from root to `/public/` directory**

   - Verified all URLs return 200 status codes
   - Removed redirect chain

### Impact
- âœ… Pages now properly indexed with full content
- âœ… No more 308 redirect chain

- âœ… Verified proper noindex settings on utility pages (404, tag pages)
- âœ… Checked robots.txt allows all search engines
- âœ… Confirmed no blocking of important content

### Pages with Intentional Noindex (Correct):
- `/not-found` (404 page) - Correctly set to noindex
- `/tag/[slug]` (tag archive pages) - Intentionally blocked
- `/admin/*` - Blocked in robots.txt âœ…
- `/api/*` - Blocked in robots.txt âœ…
