## 🎯 Optimization Strategy for Each Post

### Step 1: Identify Post Topic

For each blog post, determine which pillar page(s) it should link to:

| If Post Discusses... | Link To... | Example Anchor Text |
|---------------------|------------|---------------------|
| BCBA exam, certification, studying | `/bcba-exam-prep` | "BCBA exam preparation" |
| Working in schools, school BCBAs | `/school-based-bcba` | "school-based behavior analyst" |
| IEP goals, behavior objectives | `/iep-behavior-goals` | "writing IEP behavior goals" |
| Supervision, fieldwork hours | `/supervisors` | "BCBA supervision resources" |
| Practice tests, study materials | `/behavior-study-tools` | "free practice questions" |
| Behavior plans, BIPs, FBAs | `/behavior-plans` | "behavior intervention plans" |
| PBIS, school-wide systems | `/school-based-behavior-support` | "school-wide behavior support" |
| Training, professional development | `/transformation-program` | "professional development program" |

### Step 2: Add 2-3 Internal Links

**For each blog post:**

1. **Read through the content**
2. **Find natural mentions** of topics covered by pillar pages
3. **Highlight the text** (use natural, descriptive phrases - NOT "click here")
4. **Add link** using the editor's link tool
5. **Limit to 2-3 links per post** (don't overdo it!)

**Example:**
```
Original text: "Many school BCBAs struggle with supervision requirements."

Add link: "Many [school-based behavior analysts](/school-based-bcba) 
struggle with [supervision requirements](/supervisors)."
```
