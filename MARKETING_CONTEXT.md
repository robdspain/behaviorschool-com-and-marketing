### Secondary Audiences

**Aspiring BCBAs:**
- Currently in master's program or studying for BCBA exam
- Working as RBT or BCaBA while accumulating fieldwork hours
- Age 24-35, anxious about exam (58% pass rate)
- Active on Reddit and study groups

**RBTs:**
- Registered Behavior Technician, first job in ABA
- Age 20-30, high turnover rate (50%+ annual)
- Must earn 12 PDU hours per 2-year cycle (new requirement Jan 2026)
- Supervised by BCBAs

## Pain Points (Ranked by Intensity)

### 1. Drowning in Paperwork (THE #1 PAIN)
- FBAs take 8-15 hours each to write from scratch
- BIPs are 10-20 page documents that must be legally defensible
- Progress reports due quarterly for 20+ students simultaneously
- IEP goal writing is repetitive but must be individualized
- **60-70% of their time on documentation, not clinical work**
- "I became a BCBA to help kids, not to write reports all weekend"

### 2. Working in Isolation
- Often the only BCBA in their district or SELPA
- No peer consultation readily available
- Supervisors (if they have one) are not BCBAs themselves
- Clinical decisions made alone with no second opinion
- Miss the collaborative culture of clinic-based ABA

### 3. Burnout and Invisible Work
- Expected to be the "behavior expert" for every problem student
- Called to handle crises that pull them from planned work
- Administrative tasks eat hours (scheduling, mileage, supplies)
- No one at district office understands what they actually do
- **Year 2-3 is the breaking point** - many leave schools for clinics or quit ABA entirely

### 4. Inadequate Tools
- Using Word/Google Docs templates passed down from predecessors
- Data collection on paper or clunky district-mandated systems
- No school-specific FBA/BIP tools exist (everything is clinic-focused)
- Graphing done manually in Excel or by hand
- No system connects assessment to intervention to progress monitoring

### 5. Professional Development Desert
- District PD is for teachers, not behavior analysts
- BACB CEU requirements (32 per 2-year cycle) are expensive to fill
- Conference attendance limited by district budgets
- RBT PDU tracking is a new headache (12 hours per 2-year cycle, effective Jan 2026)
- Want to stay current on ACT/RFT but nowhere to learn applied school implementations

### 6. FERPA and Compliance Anxiety
- Everything they write could end up in a due process hearing
- Parents' attorneys scrutinize FBAs and BIPs
- Fear of writing something "wrong" that gets the district sued
- Need legally defensible language but limited legal training
- **Student data cannot go into general-purpose AI tools (FERPA violation)**

## Key Differentiator

**"Built for school BCBAs, not adapted from clinic software"**

We understand the difference between:
- Writing an FBA for an IEP meeting vs. a clinic intake
- Supporting a teacher managing 28 students vs. 1:1 therapy
- FERPA compliance vs. HIPAA compliance
- Multi-tiered interventions (PBIS, MTSS) vs. discrete trial training
- School schedules (IEP season, summer break) vs. year-round clinic billing

## Competitor Positioning

| Competitor | Their Focus | Our Advantage |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **CentralReach** | Clinic billing/scheduling, insurance claims | We are school-first, FERPA-compliant, IEP-native. No billing focus. |
| **Catalyst/Rethink** | Clinic data collection, 1:1 therapy tracking | We understand school contexts (not just 1:1 sessions). Multi-tiered support. |
| **rbtexamprep.com** | Exam prep only | We offer the full lifecycle: study to certify to practice to tools |
| **passthebigtestaba.com** | Exam prep, study materials | We provide tools for actual practice, not just studying |
| **BehaviorBabe** | General BCBA content, blog posts | We have actual software tools, not just content |
| **Generic AI (ChatGPT)** | General purpose | We are FERPA-safe, behavior-specific, legally defensible output |

## Core Messaging

### Primary Message
**"Stop writing FBAs on weekends"**

### Supporting Messages
- "From assessment to intervention in minutes, not weeks"
- "The only behavior tools that understand IEP compliance"
- "Your clinical skills matter more than your typing speed"
- "Join 500+ school BCBAs who got their evenings back"
- "FERPA-compliant AI built for behavior analysts"

### Words That Resonate
- School-based, district, SELPA, IEP, FERPA-compliant
- Save time, streamline, automate the boring parts
- Legally defensible, evidence-based, data-driven
- Community, peer support, you are not alone
- Clinical judgment (not replacing it, enhancing it)

### Words to Avoid
- "Revolutionary" or "disruptive" (skeptical of hype)
- "AI-powered" as the lead (care about outcomes, not technology)
- Clinic-specific jargon (DTT, NET, insurance billing)
- "Easy" (nothing in their job is easy - do not minimize it)
- Corporate speak (synergy, leverage, optimize)

## Voice and Tone

**Peer-to-peer, not corporate**
- "We built this because we live it too"
- Direct, practical, no fluff
- Acknowledge the real struggles without being preachy
- Light humor when appropriate (they need to laugh)

## Objection Handling

### "What about privacy/FERPA compliance?"
**Response:** Unlike ChatGPT or other general AI tools, BehaviorSchool is FERPA-compliant. We never train models on student data. All data stays in your secure account. We understand the difference between HIPAA (clinic) and FERPA (school) requirements.

### "I already have templates that work fine"
**Response:** Templates are a starting point, but they still require 8-15 hours of writing per FBA. Our tools use your clinical observations to generate function-based assessments and interventions in minutes, giving you more time for the clinical work you actually trained to do. Plus, templates don't connect assessment to intervention to progress monitoring - you start from scratch each time.

### "How much does it cost?"
**Response:** 
- **For individuals:** $19-39/month (less than one hour of your time)
- **For districts:** $139-199/seat/year (fraction of one due process case)
- **ROI:** If we save you 2 hours per week, that is 100+ hours per year back for clinical work or your life

### "My district won't pay for this"
**Response:** Many school BCBAs start with a personal subscription (professional development expense, sometimes reimbursable). Once they see the time savings, they bring it to their SPED director. We also offer district pilots and can provide ROI documentation for budget requests.

## Ideal Client Profile (ICP)

For complete ICP details including psychographics, online behavior, buying patterns, and willingness to pay, see: `/Users/Neo/clawd/icp.md`

**Key Insight from ICP:**
School BCBAs are an underserved niche within an underserved profession. Clinic-focused companies ignore them. Education companies do not understand ABA. We sit at the intersection and speak both languages. That is the moat.
