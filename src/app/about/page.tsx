        <p>
          More than 15 years ago, I was a special education teacher drowning in paperwork. Between IEP meetings, 
          data collection, progress monitoring, and lesson planning, I felt like I was spending more time on 
          documentation than actually teaching my students. Sound familiar?
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched amazing special education teachers burn out because they couldn&rsquo;t keep up with the administrative 
          demands while still providing quality instruction. There had to be a better way to track IEP goals and 
          monitor student progress without sacrificing our sanity or our students&rsquo; success.
        </p>
        <p>
          That&rsquo;s when I realized the problem wasn&rsquo;t the requirements&mdash;it was the tools. Special education teachers 
          needed software designed specifically for our unique challenges: IEP goal tracking, accommodations 
          monitoring, progress data collection, and parent communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I built ClassroomPilot&mdash;the special education teacher software I wish I had when I started. Now, 
          thousands of special ed teachers use our platform to streamline their workflow and focus on what they 
          do best: teaching.
        </p>
