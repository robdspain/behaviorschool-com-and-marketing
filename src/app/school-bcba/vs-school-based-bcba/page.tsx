          <h2>Why the Wording Matters</h2>
          <p>
            District job boards, HR systems, and candidate searches don‚Äôt always use the same phrase. ‚ÄúSchool BCBA‚Äù tends to match how candidates search, while ‚Äúschool-based BCBA‚Äù appears more often in long-form content and training resources. Optimizing for both increases discoverability without changing the work itself.
          </p>

          <h3>Typical Usage</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>School BCBA</strong>: shows up in job titles, LinkedIn profiles, and quick searches.</li>
            <li><strong>School-Based BCBA</strong>: used in articles, training, and program descriptions.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Responsibilities Are the Same</h3>
          <p>
            Regardless of title, responsibilities include FBAs, BIPs, IEP collaboration, MTSS/PBIS alignment, staff coaching, and systems-level implementation. Your portfolio (IEP goals, BIPs, coaching plans, data systems) demonstrates impact better than any title nuance.
          </p>

          <h3>How to Position Yourself</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Use both phrases across your resume and portfolio to match recruiter searches.</li>
            <li>Create artifacts that map to district needs: 90-day plan, BIP sample, coaching cycle, progress monitoring templates.</li>
            <li>Link to role-aligned tools: <Link href="/iep-behavior-goals" className="text-emerald-700 underline">IEP Goal Writer</Link>, <Link href="/behavior-plans" className="text-emerald-700 underline">Behavior Plan Writer</Link>, and the <Link href="/iep-goal-qualitychecker" className="text-emerald-700 underline">IEP Goal Quality Checker</Link>.</li>
            <li>Review salary expectations by state with our <Link href="/school-bcba/salary-by-state" className="text-emerald-700 underline">comprehensive salary guide</Link>.</li>
            <li>Prepare for interviews using our <Link href="/school-bcba/job-guide-2025" className="text-emerald-700 underline">2025 job guide</Link> with real questions and scoring rubrics.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>SEO Considerations for Districts</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Include both terms in job descriptions to maximize candidate reach.</li>
            <li>Publish a short ‚ÄúAbout the Role‚Äù page describing systems-level impact and MTSS/PBIS alignment.</li>
            <li>Link to examples of expected deliverables (FBAs, BIPs, IEP goal quality guidelines).</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>FAQs</h3>
          <p><strong>Is a "School BCBA" different from a "School-Based BCBA"?</strong> No. Both refer to a BCBA practicing in K‚Äì12 settings. The difference is language preference and search behavior.</p>
          <p><strong>Which title should I use?</strong> Use both. Lead with "School BCBA" for job search visibility, and include "school-based BCBA" in long-form materials.</p>
          <p><strong>How should I showcase impact?</strong> Provide a 90-day plan, staff coaching cycle, sample BIP, and progress monitoring visuals with clear outcomes.</p>
