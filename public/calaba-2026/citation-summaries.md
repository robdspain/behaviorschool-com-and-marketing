## PAPER 1: The Assessment Phase - Precursor Functional Analysis

### EO-Behavior-AO Framework

**Michael, J. (1993). Establishing operations. *The Behavior Analyst, 16*(2), 191-206.**

This seminal paper introduces the concept of establishing operations (EOs) as distinct from discriminative stimuli. Michael argues that behavior analysis had conflated two separate functions: the discriminative function (signaling availability of reinforcement) and the motivating function (altering the value of a consequence). This distinction is critical for the symposium's claim that traditional ABC analysis captures only observable triggers while missing the motivational variables that truly drive behavior. When a student engages in self-talk or cognitive fusion before problem behavior, the EO is the verbal/cognitive event—not the environmental antecedent observers record. The symposium's EO-Behavior-AO framework directly applies Michael's conceptual advance to school-based FBA.

**Laraway, S., Snycerski, S., Michael, J., & Poling, A. (2003). Motivating operations and terms to describe them: Some further refinements. *Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 36*(3), 407-414.**

This paper refined Michael's original terminology, introducing "motivating operation" (MO) as an umbrella term encompassing both establishing and abolishing operations. The authors clarify that MOs have two effects: value-altering (changing how reinforcing/punishing a stimulus is) and behavior-altering (changing the frequency of behavior that has produced that stimulus). For the symposium, this supports the claim that ACT interventions work by targeting the value-altering function—cognitive defusion reduces how "reinforcing" escape from uncomfortable thoughts becomes, thereby reducing escape-maintained behavior without changing environmental contingencies.

### Latency-Based Analysis Innovation

**Original KCUSD methodology based on conceptual analysis.**

The symposium's latency-based functional analysis is an original contribution from Kings Canyon USD. The decision rule—latencies >30 seconds plus observable precursors plus student self-report indicating internal mediation—represents practical innovation derived from applied experience. This approach bridges traditional FA methodology with ACT assessment by using latency as a discriminative indicator for when internal verbal events are mediating behavior.

## PAPER 2: ACT-Informed Behavior Intervention Plans

### ACT Core Framework

**Hayes, S. C., Strosahl, K. D., & Wilson, K. G. (2012). *Acceptance and commitment therapy: The process and practice of mindful change* (2nd ed.). Guilford Press.**

This is the definitive clinical manual for ACT, providing the theoretical and procedural foundation for the symposium's intervention approach. The book establishes ACT's six core processes (acceptance, defusion, present moment awareness, self-as-context, values, committed action) and explains how psychological inflexibility—the rigid dominance of verbal/cognitive control over direct environmental contingencies—underlies diverse behavioral problems. For school BCBAs, this text justifies targeting "what happens inside the student" when traditional function-based interventions fail: the student's relationship to their own thoughts is the functional variable.

**Hayes, S. C., Luoma, J. B., Bond, F. W., Masuda, A., & Lillis, J. (2006). Acceptance and commitment therapy: Model, processes and outcomes. *Behaviour Research and Therapy, 44*(1), 1-25.**

This review summarizes the empirical basis for ACT across clinical populations. Crucially for the symposium's evidence claims, the paper documents ACT's efficacy across anxiety, depression, chronic pain, and workplace performance—demonstrating that psychological flexibility is a transdiagnostic process variable. The symposium leverages this evidence to argue that ACT-informed BIPs can address behaviors maintained by avoidance of internal experiences (thoughts, feelings) that traditional FBAs miss.

### Relational Frame Theory (Theoretical Foundation)

**Hayes, S. C., Barnes-Holmes, D., & Roche, B. (Eds.). (2001). *Relational frame theory: A post-Skinnerian account of human language and cognition*. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers.**

RFT provides the behavior-analytic foundation for ACT. This edited volume explains how humans derive relations among stimuli (equivalence, opposition, comparison, temporal relations) through a history of multiple-exemplar training. The key insight for school behavior support: once a student derives that "I'm stupid" is equivalent to failure experiences, the thought itself acquires aversive functions—and escape from the thought (not just escape from the academic task) can maintain avoidance behavior. This explains why manipulating environmental contingencies alone fails when the behavior is "rule-governed" by derived verbal relations.

**Barnes-Holmes, Y., Barnes-Holmes, D., & McHugh, L. (2004). Teaching derived relational responding to young children. *Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention, 1*(1), 3-12. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0100275**

This foundational study demonstrates that derived relational responding can be explicitly taught to young children through multiple-exemplar training. The research establishes that the building blocks of complex verbal behavior—the same processes underlying cognitive fusion and rule-governed behavior—emerge through learning history rather than biological maturation alone. For the symposium's assessment methodology, this supports the premise that students' verbal statements (the content being challenged in the validating vs. challenging conditions) acquired their stimulus functions through derived relational responding, and therefore latency differences reveal differential fusion with specific verbal content.

**Foody, M., Barnes-Holmes, Y., Barnes-Holmes, D., Törneke, N., Luciano, C., Stewart, I., & McEnteggart, C. (2014). RFT for clinical use: The example of metaphor. *Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science, 3*(4), 305-313. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2014.08.001**

This paper bridges RFT theory and ACT clinical practice, demonstrating how metaphor functions through derived relational responding to promote defusion. The authors explain that metaphors work by establishing new relational frames that alter the functions of problematic verbal content without directly challenging the content itself. For the symposium, this citation supports the intervention phase: once the latency-based assessment identifies which verbal statements show least psychological flexibility (shortest latency to precursors when challenged), metaphor-based defusion interventions specifically target those high-fusion statements—the transformation of stimulus functions reduces the aversive properties of the verbal content.

### ACT Matrix

**Polk, K. L., & Schoendorff, B. (Eds.). (2014). *The ACT matrix: A new approach to building psychological flexibility across settings and populations*. New Harbinger Publications.**

The ACT Matrix is a visual tool that helps individuals (including children) distinguish between "toward" moves (values-consistent behavior) and "away" moves (experiential avoidance). The symposium uses the Matrix as both an assessment tool (mapping students' current patterns) and an intervention framework (helping students notice the workability of their choices). This citation supports the symposium's claim that ACT concepts can be made accessible and practical for school settings.

### ACT with Youth

**Greco, L. A., & Hayes, S. C. (Eds.). (2008). *Acceptance and mindfulness treatments for children and adolescents: A practitioner's guide*. New Harbinger Publications.**

This edited volume addresses the unique considerations for ACT implementation with children. The authors discuss developmental adaptations including simplified language, concrete metaphors, and activity-based exercises. For the symposium's population (school-age students), this text provides empirical and clinical guidance supporting the feasibility of ACT-informed interventions in educational settings. It also introduces the CPFQ and related assessment tools for youth.

### Children's Psychological Flexibility Questionnaire

**Greco, L. A., Lambert, W., & Baer, R. A. (2008). Psychological inflexibility in childhood and adolescence: Development and evaluation of the Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth. *Psychological Assessment, 20*(2), 93-102.**

This paper reports the psychometric development of the AFQ-Y (Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth), which measures psychological inflexibility in children. The measure shows good internal consistency (α = .90) and correlates with anxiety, somatic complaints, and behavior problems. For the symposium, this citation supports using standardized measurement of psychological flexibility as both a baseline assessment and outcome measure—enabling data-based decision-making about whether ACT-informed interventions are working.

## PAPER 3: Implementation & Fidelity

### Behavioral Skills Training (BST)

**Parsons, M. B., Rollyson, J. H., & Reid, D. H. (2012). Evidence-based staff training: A guide for practitioners. *Behavior Analysis in Practice, 5*(2), 2-11.**

This paper provides the gold standard for training implementers in behavior-analytic procedures. BST consists of four components: instruction, modeling, rehearsal, and feedback. The symposium's implementation protocol uses BST to train teachers and paraprofessionals in ACT-informed strategies. This citation supports the claim that effective BIP implementation requires more than just handing staff a written plan—structured training with practice and feedback is essential.

**Sarokoff, R. A., & Sturmey, P. (2004). The effects of behavioral skills training on staff implementation of discrete-trial teaching. *Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 37*(4), 535-538.**

This empirical study demonstrated that BST significantly improved staff implementation of discrete-trial procedures, with improvements maintaining at follow-up. While focused on DTT rather than BIPs, the study establishes that BST is effective for training complex behavioral procedures. The symposium extrapolates this evidence to ACT-informed BIP implementation.

### Implementation Fidelity Research

**Noell, G. H., Witt, J. C., Slider, N. J., Connell, J. E., Gatti, S. L., Williams, K. L., ... & Duhon, G. J. (2005). Treatment implementation following behavioral consultation in schools: A comparison of three follow-up strategies. *School Psychology Review, 34*(1), 87-106.**

This study found that teachers' implementation of behavior plans dropped to 40-60% accuracy within days after initial training unless follow-up support was provided. Performance feedback—brief meetings providing implementation data—maintained higher fidelity than either no follow-up or commitment emphasis alone. The symposium cites this research to justify the implementation support systems described in Paper 3: without ongoing feedback, even well-designed BIPs fail at the implementation stage.

**DiGennaro Reed, F. D., Codding, R., Catania, C. N., & Maguire, H. (2010). Effects of video modeling on treatment integrity of behavioral interventions. *Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 43*(2), 291-295.**

This study demonstrated that video modeling (showing correct implementation) combined with performance feedback improved treatment integrity for behavioral interventions. The symposium's implementation protocol incorporates video modeling as part of the BST sequence—trainers demonstrate ACT-informed strategies via video before live modeling and practice.

### Multi-Tiered Systems of Support

**Sugai, G., & Horner, R. H. (2009). Responsiveness-to-intervention and school-wide positive behavior supports: Integration of multi-tiered system approaches. *Exceptionality, 17*(4), 223-237.**

This paper articulates how PBIS and RTI frameworks can be integrated into a unified multi-tiered system. The symposium's 5-tier model at KCUSD builds on this conceptual framework, positioning ACT-informed FBA/BIP as Tier 4 intervention for students who don't respond to standard function-based approaches. This citation supports the claim that the symposium's innovations fit within established MTSS frameworks.

## PAPER 4: Outcomes & Social Validity

### Social Validity Framework

**Wolf, M. M. (1978). Social validity: The case for subjective measurement or how applied behavior analysis is finding its heart. *Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 11*(2), 203-214.**

Wolf's classic paper argues that behavior analysis must attend to three dimensions of social validity: (1) the social significance of goals, (2) the social appropriateness of procedures, and (3) the social importance of effects. The symposium's inclusion of student voice data, teacher acceptability ratings, and family feedback directly implements Wolf's framework. This citation supports the claim that ACT-informed BIPs are not only effective but also acceptable to consumers—a critical consideration for school adoption.

### Function-Based Intervention Effectiveness

**Newcomer, L. L., & Lewis, T. J. (2004). Functional behavioral assessment: An investigation of assessment reliability and effectiveness of function-based interventions. *Journal of Emotional and Behavioral Disorders, 12*(3), 168-181.**

This study found that function-based interventions were significantly more effective than non-function-based interventions (effect size d = 0.78). The symposium uses this evidence to argue that identifying the correct function—including when internal verbal events are the functional variable—is essential for intervention success. When traditional FBA misidentifies function (attributing escape-from-task when the actual function is escape-from-thoughts-triggered-by-task), interventions based on that faulty hypothesis will fail.

**Ingram, K., Lewis-Palmer, T., & Sugai, G. (2005). Function-based intervention planning: Comparing the effectiveness of FBA function-based and non-function-based intervention plans. *Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions, 7*(4), 224-236.**

This study replicated findings that function-based interventions outperform default interventions. Importantly, the authors note that accurate function identification is the critical variable—when function is correctly identified, intervention effectiveness follows. The symposium extends this logic to argue that ACT-informed assessment provides more accurate function identification for internally-mediated behavior.

### Single-Case Research Standards

**Ledford, J. R., & Gast, D. L. (2018). *Single case research methodology: Applications in special education and behavioral sciences* (3rd ed.). Routledge.**

This text provides the methodological standards for single-case design research in special education. The symposium's outcome data use A-B-A-B reversal and multiple-baseline designs consistent with What Works Clearinghouse standards. This citation supports the claim that the preliminary evidence meets rigorous single-case design criteria.

## Functional Analysis Methodology

### Classic FA

**Iwata, B. A., Dorsey, M. F., Slifer, K. J., Bauman, K. E., & Richman, G. S. (1982/1994). Toward a functional analysis of self-injury. *Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 27*(2), 197-209.**

This landmark paper established the standard FA methodology comparing attention, escape, tangible, and alone conditions. While the symposium argues that traditional FA may miss internally-mediated functions, this citation acknowledges the foundational contribution and explains that latency-based FA is an extension—not a replacement—of established methods.

### Practical Functional Assessment

**Hanley, G. P., Jin, C. S., Vanselow, N. R., & Hanratty, L. A. (2014). Producing meaningful improvements in problem behavior of children with autism via synthesized analyses and treatments. *Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 47*(1), 16-36.**

This paper introduced the Interview-Informed Synthesized Contingency Analysis (IISCA), which the symposium references as "Pathway A" for behaviors maintained by external contingencies. Hanley's practical functional assessment is faster and more clinically relevant than traditional extended FAs. The symposium positions ACT-informed assessment as "Pathway B"—a parallel approach for internally-mediated behavior, just as IISCA is a practical alternative to extended FA for externally-maintained behavior.

**Hanley, G. P. (2012). Functional assessment of problem behavior: Dispelling myths, overcoming implementation obstacles, and developing new lore. *Behavior Analysis in Practice, 5*(1), 54-72.**

This review addresses common misconceptions about FA implementation in applied settings. Hanley argues for flexible, clinically-informed approaches rather than rigid protocols. The symposium extends this flexibility argument to include assessment of internal verbal events when behavioral indicators suggest internal mediation.
