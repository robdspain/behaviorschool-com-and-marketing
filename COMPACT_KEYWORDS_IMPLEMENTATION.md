# Compact Keywords Implementation - Behavior School

**Date:** January 2025
**Strategy:** Edward Sturm's Compact Keywords (High-Intent SEO)

---

## What Are Compact Keywords?

**"Compact Keywords"** (coined by Edward Sturm) is the strategy of targeting **bottom-of-funnel, high-intent keywords** (conversion keywords) rather than generic or educational content. These are keywords that reflect someone ready to act or invest.

### Core Characteristics:
- **Lower search volume** but much less competition
- **Pages are shorter** (400-600 words) and optimized to convert
- **Clear call to action** on every page
- **SEO landing pages** rather than long blog posts
- Examples: "behavior consulting for schools", "behavior coaching program", "school behavior consultant services"

### Key Principles:
1. **Match the search exactly** - If someone searches "BCBA supervision tools", your title should be "BCBA Supervision Tools"
2. **Target warm buyers** - People ready to use your product NOW (not learning about it)
3. **Be direct** - No fluff, no long preamble, immediate value
4. **Keep it short** - 2-4 words for primary keyword
5. **Focus on conversion** - Clear next step on every page

### Strategic Fit for Your Funnel:

**Your funnel:** visitor ‚Üí community/apps ‚Üí nurture ‚Üí transformation program

Using Compact Keywords you can:
1. **Attract high-intent visitors** (e.g., school admin searching "behavior coaching program for schools" or BCBA searching "reduce staff turnover special ed")
2. **Send them to landing pages** that introduce your community or app (free value)
3. **Get them in** (free trial, lead magnet, community signup)
4. **Nurture and convert** to transformation program

Your SEO becomes an **acquisition channel** that feeds the top of your ecosystem.

## üîç How to Find Compact Keywords Using Google Keyword Planner

### Goal:
Find **low-volume, high-intent phrases** that signal someone is ready to act (hire, enroll, buy, join).

### Step-by-Step Process:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Access the Tool
1. Go to [ads.google.com](https://ads.google.com)
2. Click **Tools & Settings** icon (top bar)
3. Under **Planning**, choose **Keyword Planner**
4. Pick **Discover new keywords**

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Seed Keyword Ideas

Start broad with phrases that describe what you actually sell (not educational content).

**Examples for Behavior School:**
- school behavior coaching program
- BCBA training for schools
- classroom behavior intervention program
- functional behavior assessment training
- school-wide behavior systems
- MTSS behavior coaching
- teacher behavior training program

   - **Competition:** Low or Medium
   - **Include terms:** "program," "training," "consultant," "service," "system," "for schools"
   - **Exclude terms:** "what is," "definition," "examples," "how to"

üëâ This will leave you with **bottom-funnel keywords** ‚Äî people who want solutions.

‚úÖ "program," "training," "consultant," "system," "for schools," "hire," "apply," "services"
