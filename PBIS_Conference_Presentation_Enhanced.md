## How Districts Can Maximize Behavioral Expertise for Student Success

*Transforming school-wide behavior support through evidence-based collaboration*

---

### Slide 5: The Evolution of BCBAs in Schools
**BCBAs in Schools: A Growing Movement**

üìà **Timeline & Growth:**

---

### Slide 13: Tier 3 Deep Dive - Individual Support

**Current State:** BCBAs are well-established in Tier 3 services statewide

üìà **Typical Services:**
- Comprehensive FBAs for special education students
- Behavior intervention plan (BIP) development and monitoring
- IEP team collaboration and goal development
- Crisis response and safety planning

üîÑ **Expansion Opportunities:**

**Situation:** Student with existing Section 504 plan showing declining response to current interventions

**BCBA Intervention:**
- Collaborative assessment with school therapist
- Integration with existing "Zones of Regulation" framework
- Function-based intervention design within familiar structure

**Key Strategy:** *Individualization within universal frameworks*

**Outcome:** Improved intervention effectiveness while maintaining consistency with school-wide approaches

**Principle:** Even when programming appears universal, individualization addresses specific barriers and enhances implementation success

---

### Slide 15: Audience Share - Tier 3 Examples

üéØ **BCBA Value-Add at Tier 2:**
- Reinforcement system design and implementation
- Intervention package customization
- Staff training in evidence-based practices
- Data collection and progress monitoring systems

**Population Served:** General education students with emerging behavioral concerns

---

### Slide 17: Tier 2 Success Example  
**Case Study: Middle School CICO Implementation**

**Challenge:** Multiple students showing off-task behavior, calling out, mild disruption

**BCBA-Led Solution:**
1. **Assessment:** Multi-source data review to identify Tier 2 candidates
2. **Design:** Streamlined Check-In/Check-Out system with clear procedures
3. **Training:** Behavioral Skills Training (BST) for staff on:
   - Student greeting protocols
   - Goal review and feedback delivery  
   - Consistent reinforcement procedures
4. **Group Intervention:** Co-facilitated replacement behavior instruction
5. **Monitoring:** Daily point tracking with goal attainment analysis

**Innovation:** Evolution from simple "star charts" to meaningful, targeted goal achievement

**Staff Development:** Using RBTs as implementation models and peer coaches

---

### Slide 18: Audience Share - Tier 2 Examples

*[Allow 3-4 participants to share examples]*

---

### Slide 19: Tier 1 Deep Dive - Universal Support

**Missed Opportunity:** BCBAs often underutilized at Tier 1 despite having relevant expertise

üéØ **Current Reality:**
- Many schools have Tier 1 support staff
- Not all staff trained in behavior change science

*[Allow 3-4 participants to share examples]*

---

### Slide 23: BCBAs and RBTs - Team Approach
**Expanding Impact Through Paraprofessional Expertise**

**Registered Behavior Technicians (RBTs):**
- Primary role: Intervention implementation under BCBA supervision
- **Value-add:** Expert implementers can serve as models and coaches
- **Capacity building:** Train other implementers (teachers, counselors, support staff)

üéØ **Strategic Utilization:**
- RBTs model implementation across all PBIS tiers
- Provide peer coaching to school staff
- Bridge between BCBA design and classroom reality

**Case Example:** *Megan's SFUSD 6-week fade system*

- RBT modeling and coaching
- Sustainable handoff to school staff

---

### Slide 24: Implementation Barriers
**What's Getting in the Way?**

### üö´ **Capacity Constraints**
- **Issue:** BCBA job duties far exceed available hours
- **Impact:** Reactive rather than proactive service delivery
- **Solution:** Systematic prioritization and delegation

### üö´ **Systems Access Limitations**  
- **Issue:** BCBAs hired specifically for special education services
- **Impact:** Limited access to general education settings and universal interventions
