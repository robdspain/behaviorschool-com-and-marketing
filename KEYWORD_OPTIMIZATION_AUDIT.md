## Keyword Cannibalization Analysis

### 🔴 CRITICAL: BCBA Practice Exam/Mock Exam Overlap

**Issue:** Three pages targeting nearly identical keywords:
- `/bcba-mock-practice-test` → "BCBA Mock Exam"
- `/free-bcba-mock-practice-test` → "BCBA Practice Exam"
- `/bcba-practice-exam` → "BCBA Practice Exam"
- `/free-bcba-practice-exam` → "BCBA Practice Exam" (10 questions)

**Recommendation:**
1. **Differentiate by intent:**
   - `/bcba-mock-practice-test` → "BCBA Mock Exam: 185-Question Full-Length Test"
   - `/free-bcba-mock-practice-test` → "Free BCBA Mock Exam: No Signup Required"
   - `/bcba-practice-exam` → "BCBA Practice Questions: Unlimited Adaptive Study"
   - `/free-bcba-practice-exam` → "Quick BCBA Practice Test: 10 Questions in 5 Minutes"

2. **Consider consolidation:**
   - Merge `/free-bcba-mock-practice-test` and `/free-bcba-practice-exam` into one page
   - Use URL parameters or tabs to differentiate (10q vs 185q format)

### 🟡 MODERATE: IEP Goals Duplication

**Issue:** Two pages with identical keyword targets:
- `/iep-goals` → "IEP Behavior Goals"
- `/iep-behavior-goals` → "IEP Behavior Goals"

**Recommendation:**
- `/iep-goals` → Broader: "IEP Goals Generator: Academic, Social & Behavior Goals" (expand scope)
- `/iep-behavior-goals` → Specific: "IEP Behavior Goals: Free Generator for Problem Behaviors"

### 🟢 MINOR: School BCBA Variations

**Issue:** Multiple school BCBA pages with similar content:
- `/school-based-bcba` → "School-Based BCBA"
- `/school-bcba` → Likely targets "School BCBA"

**Recommendation:**
- Differentiate clearly:
  - `/school-based-bcba` → "School-Based BCBA Career Guide: Systems & Training"
  - `/school-bcba` → "School BCBA Hub: Tools, Resources & Community"

## Title Restructuring Priority List

### 🔥 HIGH PRIORITY (Immediate Action Required)

1. **`/bcba-exam-prep`**
   - Current: No metadata/client-side only
   - Recommended: "BCBA Exam Prep: Free Study Guide + 185-Q Mock Test"
   - Impact: Core landing page for exam prep traffic

2. **`/transformation-program`**
   - Current: No title metadata
   - Recommended: "School BCBA Transformation → 8-Week Cohort Program"
   - Impact: Premium product page, high commercial intent

3. **`/supervisors`**
   - Current: No clear title
   - Recommended: "BCBA Supervision Tools → Track Fieldwork & Competencies"
   - Impact: Key product differentiator

### 🔶 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Next Sprint)

4. **`/community`**
   - Current: "Join the Behavior School Community | Support for School-Based BCBAs"
   - Recommended: "School-Based BCBA Community → Join Free Today"
   - Rationale: Move keyword to front, add urgency

5. **`/school-based-bcba`**
   - Current: "School-Based School BCBA Transformation System: From Crisis Manager to Systems Leader"
   - Recommended: "School-Based BCBA Guide → Career, Systems & Training"
   - Rationale: Simplify, remove redundancy, clearer intent

6. **`/the-act-matrix-a-framework-for-school-based-bcbas`**
   - Current: Unknown (needs analysis)
   - Recommended: "ACT Matrix for School BCBAs → Implementation Framework"
   - Rationale: Keyword at start, clearer topic

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have)

7. **`/` (Homepage)**
   - Current: "Free BCBA Exam Prep & Mock Tests → Boost Your Certification Prep | Behavior School"
   - Recommended: "BCBA Exam Prep: Free Mock Tests + Study Tools | Behavior School"
   - Rationale: Slightly shorter, maintains keyword position

8. **`/iep-goals`**
   - Current: "FREE IEP Behavior Goal Writer | Full Goal Writer Coming Soon | Behavior School"
   - Recommended: "IEP Behavior Goals Generator → Free SMART Goal Writer"
   - Rationale: Cleaner format, remove "coming soon" noise

## SEO Best Practices Compliance

### ✅ STRENGTHS

1. **Comprehensive Metadata**
   - Most pages have proper OpenGraph and Twitter card data
   - Canonical URLs properly set
   - Robots directives correctly configured

2. **Strong Keyword Research**
   - Long-tail keyword variations well-covered
   - Good semantic clustering (BCBA exam prep, practice test, mock exam)
   - School-based focus clearly differentiated

3. **Structured Data**
   - Rich FAQ schemas on key pages
   - Proper Course/Product schemas
   - Person schema for Rob Spain (founder credibility)

### ⚠️ AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT

1. **Title Length Consistency**
   - Some titles exceed 60 characters (will truncate in SERPs)
   - Example: `/school-based-bcba` title is 85+ characters
   - **Fix:** Keep titles under 60 chars, brand name can truncate

2. **Keyword Density in Descriptions**
   - Some meta descriptions don't include primary keyword
   - Example: `/about` focuses on Rob Spain but doesn't say "BCBA training"
   - **Fix:** First 120 characters should include primary keyword

3. **Internal Linking Anchor Text**
   - Many links use generic text like "Learn More"
   - **Fix:** Use keyword-rich anchors: "See BCBA Exam Prep Guide" instead of "Learn More"

---

## Recommended Title Format

### Pattern: `[Primary Keyword] → [Clear Benefit] | [Brand]`

**Examples:**
- ✅ GOOD: "BCBA Mock Exam → Free 185 Questions + Instant Results"
- ✅ GOOD: "IEP Behavior Goals Generator → Create SMART Goals in Minutes"
- ❌ BAD: "Transform Your Practice with Our Comprehensive BCBA Program"

### Rules:
1. **Primary keyword in first 3 words** (under 20 characters)
2. **Use arrow (→) or colon (:) separator** for scannability
3. **Clear benefit statement** (not vague promises)
4. **Brand at end** (can truncate without losing meaning)
5. **Keep total under 60 characters** when possible

## Technical Notes

### Next.js Metadata Best Practices

**Issue Found:** Several pages use client-side components without clear metadata exports.

**Solution:**
```typescript
// In page.tsx (Server Component)
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Primary Keyword → Benefit | Brand",
  description: "Primary keyword in first 120 chars...",
  // ... other metadata
};

export default function Page() {
  return <ClientComponent />;
}
```

**Pages Needing This Fix:**
- `/bcba-exam-prep/page.tsx`
- `/transformation-program/page.tsx`
- `/supervisors/page.tsx`

---

## Keyword Priority Matrix

### High-Volume, High-Intent Keywords (Focus Here First)
1. **BCBA Exam Prep** (2,400/mo, Commercial)
2. **BCBA Practice Test** (1,900/mo, Commercial)
3. **BCBA Mock Exam** (1,600/mo, Commercial)
4. **IEP Behavior Goals** (880/mo, Informational → Transactional)
5. **School-Based BCBA** (590/mo, Informational)
