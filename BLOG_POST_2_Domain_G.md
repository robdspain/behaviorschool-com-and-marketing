## Introduction

Domain G (Behavior-Change Procedures) is the **LARGEST domain** on the BCBA exam, representing **24-26% of all questions** (approximately 24-26 questions out of 85 scored). If you want to pass the BCBA exam, you absolutely must master Domain G.

This domain covers the "how" of behavior analysis—the actual procedures you'll use to increase desirable behaviors and decrease problem behaviors. It's the most applied, practical domain, testing your ability to:
- Select appropriate interventions
- Implement procedures correctly
- Troubleshoot when interventions don't work
- Ensure generalization and maintenance

**What You'll Get in This Post:**
- 30 challenging Domain G practice questions
- Detailed explanations for every answer
- Common mistakes and how to avoid them
- Study strategies for the largest BCBA domain

## Why Domain G Is the Hardest BCBA Section

### 1. Largest Content Area
With 24-26% of exam questions, Domain G requires the most study time. Miss half of Domain G and you're looking at 12-13 questions wrong before other domains.

### 2. Requires Integration
Domain G questions don't just test definitions. They require you to:
- Apply concepts to novel scenarios
- Distinguish between similar procedures
- Select the MOST effective intervention
- Troubleshoot implementation problems

### 3. High-Stakes Clinical Decisions
Unlike philosophical concepts in Domain A, Domain G tests real-world judgment. Getting reinforcement schedules wrong in practice can harm clients.

### 4. Most Common BCBA Exam Complaints
After the exam, candidates most often report:
- "Domain G questions were way harder than practice tests"
- "I couldn't tell the difference between the answer choices"
- "Scenarios were longer and more complex"

**The Solution:** Practice with realistic, application-based questions like those below.

## 30 Practice Questions by Topic

### Reinforcement Procedures (Questions 1-8)

#### Question 1: Positive vs. Negative Reinforcement
**A student with autism engages in hand-flapping during transitions. The teacher gives the student a fidget toy during transitions, and hand-flapping decreases. Which procedure is being used?**

A) Positive reinforcement
B) Negative reinforcement
C) DRI (Differential Reinforcement of Incompatible behavior)
D) Response blocking

**Answer: C) DRI (Differential Reinforcement of Incompatible behavior)**

**Explanation:** This is a trick question! While it looks like reinforcement, the fidget toy serves as an **incompatible behavior**—the student can't hand-flap while holding the fidget. The teacher is reinforcing fidget use (incompatible with hand-flapping).

**Why not A?** Not positive reinforcement because nothing is being added contingent on hand-flapping
**Why not B?** Nothing aversive is being removed
**Why not D?** Response blocking would be physically preventing hand-flapping

**Key Distinction:** If the fidget reduced hand-flapping by meeting the *same function* (e.g., providing sensory input), it would be positive reinforcement. Since it's physically incompatible, it's DRI.

---

#### Question 2: Schedules of Reinforcement - Maintenance
**A BCBA wants to promote maintenance of a newly acquired skill. Which schedule would be MOST appropriate once the behavior is established?**

A) Continuous reinforcement (CRF)
B) Fixed ratio 3 (FR3)
C) Variable ratio 10 (VR10)
D) Differential reinforcement of high rates (DRH)

**Answer: C) Variable ratio 10 (VR10)**

**Explanation:** For maintenance, you want:
- **High resistance to extinction**
- **Natural-like contingencies**
- **Unpredictability**

Variable ratio schedules produce the highest resistance to extinction.

**Why not A?** CRF is for acquisition, not maintenance—too dense, unnatural
**Why not B?** Fixed schedules produce post-reinforcement pauses and are less resistant to extinction
**Why not D?** DRH is for increasing *rate*, not maintaining established behavior

**Pro Tip:** Think of natural reinforcement as mostly VR/VI (unpredictable). You don't get attention every single time you greet someone (CRF), but you do sometimes (VR).

---

#### Question 3: Preference Assessments
**A BCBA conducts a multiple-stimulus without replacement (MSWO) preference assessment. After each selection, the chosen item is:**

A) Removed from the array for the remainder of the assessment
B) Returned to the array after the student interacts with it
C) Only removed if the student doesn't engage with it
D) Replaced with a novel item

**Answer: A) Removed from the array for the remainder of the assessment**

**Explanation:** "Without replacement" means once an item is selected, it's removed—preventing repeated selection of the same high-preference item.

**Preference Assessment Types:**
| Type | Description | When to Use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **MS** (Multiple Stimulus) | Items remain available | Quick screening |
| **MSWO** | Items removed after selection | Rank ordering |
| **PS** (Paired Stimulus) | Two items presented | Precise rankings |
| **Free Operant** | Open access to items | Naturalistic |

**Why not B?** That's MS (with replacement)
**Why not C-D?** Not standard procedures

---

#### Question 4: Token Economies
**In a classroom token economy, students earn points for completed work but can only exchange points for rewards during scheduled break times. This is an example of:**

A) Intermittent reinforcement
B) Generalized conditioned reinforcement
C) Delayed reinforcement
D) All of the above

**Answer: D) All of the above**

**Explanation:** Token economies demonstrate multiple principles:
- **Intermittent:** Not every response earns a token
- **Generalized conditioned:** Tokens can be exchanged for multiple backup reinforcers
- **Delayed:** Exchange happens later, not immediately after behavior

This is why token economies are so powerful—they bridge the gap between behavior and delayed natural reinforcers.

---

#### Question 5: Contingency Contracting
**A contingency contract states: "If Juan completes 5 math problems with 80% accuracy, he can choose 10 minutes of computer time." What makes this a behavioral contract?**

A) It specifies the target behavior only
B) It includes criteria for reinforcement delivery
C) It outlines both the behavior requirement and the reinforcer
D) It's signed by all parties

**Answer: C) It outlines both the behavior requirement and the reinforcer**

**Explanation:** Effective behavioral contracts must include:
1. **Target behavior** (complete 5 math problems)
2. **Criterion** (80% accuracy)
3. **Reinforcer** (10 min computer time)
4. **Schedule/timeline** (implied: after completion)

**Why not A?** Missing the reinforcer
**Why not B?** Missing the specific behavior
**Why not D?** While signatures help with buy-in, they're not what defines a behavioral contract

---

### Extinction & Differential Reinforcement (Questions 6-11)

#### Question 6: Extinction Burst
**A teacher begins ignoring a student's hand-raising (previously reinforced with immediate attention). On Day 2, the student raises their hand 15 times (up from baseline of 5 times). This is an example of:**

A) Spontaneous recovery
B) Extinction burst
C) Resistance to extinction
D) Behavioral contrast

**Answer: B) Extinction burst**

**Explanation:** An **extinction burst** is a temporary *increase* in the frequency, duration, or intensity of behavior when reinforcement is first withheld.

**Common Extinction Effects:**
- **Extinction burst:** Temporary increase (Days 1-3)
- **Spontaneous recovery:** Behavior reappears after being reduced
- **Emotional behavior:** Frustration, aggression
- **Response variability:** Trying different forms of behavior

**Why not A?** Spontaneous recovery happens *after* behavior has decreased
**Why not C?** Resistance to extinction is how long behavior persists, not a temporary increase
**Why not D?** Behavioral contrast is increase in one setting when behavior is punished in another

---

#### Question 7: DRA vs. DRI vs. DRO
**A student hits peers to access toys. The BCBA teaches the student to say "Can I have a turn?" and provides access to toys contingent on appropriate requests. This is:**

A) DRO (Differential Reinforcement of Other behavior)
B) DRI (Differential Reinforcement of Incompatible behavior)
C) DRA (Differential Reinforcement of Alternative behavior)
D) DRL (Differential Reinforcement of Low rates)

**Answer: C) DRA (Differential Reinforcement of Alternative behavior)**

**Explanation:**
- **DRA:** Reinforce an alternative behavior (appropriate requesting) that serves the *same function* (accessing toys)
- **DRI:** Reinforce an incompatible behavior (can't hit and keep hands in pockets simultaneously)
- **DRO:** Reinforce absence of problem behavior (reinforce if NO hitting occurs)

**Decision Tree:**
1. Does the alternative serve the same function? → **DRA**
2. Is it physically impossible to do both? → **DRI**
3. Are you just reinforcing when problem behavior doesn't occur? → **DRO**

**Why not B?** Requesting and hitting aren't physically incompatible
**Why not D?** DRL is for reducing *rate*, not replacing behavior

---

#### Question 8: DRL Implementation
**A student calls out 20 times per hour. The teacher implements DRL, providing reinforcement if call-outs occur 15 or fewer times per hour. This is an example of:**

A) Full-session DRL
B) Spaced-responding DRL
C) Interval DRL
D) Progressive DRL

**Answer: A) Full-session DRL**

**Explanation:** **Full-session DRL** sets a criterion for the total session (e.g., ≤15 times in 60 minutes).

**DRL Variations:**
- **Full-session:** Total count for entire session
- **Spaced-responding:** Reinforce if sufficient time passes *between* responses
- **Interval:** Break session into intervals, reinforce if criterion met in each

**Why not B?** Spaced-responding would be "reinforce if 5+ minutes between call-outs"
**Why not C?** Interval would be "reinforce if ≤3 call-outs per 15-min interval"
**Why not D?** Not a standard DRL type

---

### Punishment & Reductive Procedures (Questions 9-14)

#### Question 9: Punishment Definition
**After a student swears in class, the teacher assigns extra homework. Swearing decreases. The extra homework functioned as:**

A) Positive punishment
B) Negative punishment
C) Negative reinforcement
D) Response cost

**Answer: A) Positive punishment**

**Explanation:**
- **Positive punishment:** Something *added* (extra homework) that *decreases* behavior (swearing)
- **Negative punishment:** Something *removed* (e.g., recess) that *decreases* behavior

**Memory Trick:**
- **Positive** = Add (+)
- **Negative** = Remove (-)
- **Punishment** = Behavior decreases
- **Reinforcement** = Behavior increases

**Why not B?** Nothing was removed
**Why not C?** Behavior decreased (punishment), not increased (reinforcement)
**Why not D?** Response cost is a *type* of negative punishment (removing tokens/points), not extra homework

---

#### Question 10: Timeout Types
**During timeout, a student is required to sit in a chair in the back of the classroom, still able to see and hear activities. This is:**

A) Exclusion timeout
B) Seclusionary timeout
C) Non-exclusionary timeout
D) Response cost

**Answer: C) Non-exclusionary timeout**

**Explanation:**
- **Non-exclusionary:** Student remains in environment but loses access to reinforcement (can still see/hear)
- **Exclusion:** Student removed from environment (hallway, timeout room with window)
- **Seclusionary:** Student fully isolated (locked timeout room)

**Timeout Continuum (Least to Most Restrictive):**
1. **Planned ignoring** (simplest)
2. **Non-exclusionary** (chair in classroom)
3. **Exclusion** (removed to hallway)
4. **Seclusionary** (isolated room) ← Most restrictive, rarely justified

**Why not A?** Student isn't excluded from the environment
**Why not B?** Student can still observe classroom (not secluded)
**Why not D?** Response cost is removing tangible items/points, not access to environment

## Common Domain G Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Confusing Similar Procedures
**Problem:** DRA, DRI, DRO all sound similar
**Solution:** Focus on the function:
- **DRA:** Alternative behavior serves same function (replacement)
- **DRI:** Physically incompatible
- **DRO:** Absence of problem behavior (no specific replacement taught)

### Mistake #2: Forgetting to Consider Function
**Problem:** Choosing extinction for attention-maintained behavior while teacher still provides reprimands
**Solution:** Always ask: "What is maintaining this behavior?" Intervention must address function.

### Mistake #3: Misidentifying Reinforcement Type
**Problem:** Calling removal of aversives "negative reinforcement" when behavior decreases
**Solution:** Check the effect:
- Behavior increases = Reinforcement
- Behavior decreases = Punishment
Then determine positive (add) vs. negative (remove)

### Mistake #4: Selecting Punishment Too Quickly
**Problem:** Jumping to timeout without trying reinforcement-based approaches
**Solution:** Punishment should be last resort. Hierarchy:
1. Reinforce alternative/incompatible behavior (DRA/DRI)
2. Extinction + reinforcement
3. Non-exclusionary timeout
4. Exclusionary procedures (rare)

## Study Strategies for Domain G Success

### 1. Create Comparison Charts
Make side-by-side comparisons:

| Procedure | Add or Remove | Increases or Decreases | Example |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|---------|
| Positive Reinforcement | Add | Increases | Praise for homework |
| Negative Reinforcement | Remove | Increases | Remove difficult work after compliance |
| Positive Punishment | Add | Decreases | Reprimand for disruption |
| Negative Punishment | Remove | Decreases | Response cost (lose tokens) |

### 2. Practice Application Questions
Don't just memorize definitions—practice applying them:
- Given this scenario, which is the BEST intervention?
- Why would extinction fail in this situation?
- What schedule promotes maintenance?

### 3. Use the "Function Test"
For every intervention question, ask:
1. What function is the behavior serving?
2. Does the intervention address that function?
3. Will it work in this context?

### 4. Master Differential Reinforcement
DRA, DRI, DRO, DRL, DRH are heavily tested. Create examples for each in your own practice setting.

### 5. Know Punishment Hierarchy
Least restrictive to most restrictive procedures. BCBA exam favors least restrictive options when multiple answers would work.

## FAQ: Domain G BCBA Exam Questions

### How many Domain G questions are on the BCBA exam?
Domain G represents **24-26% of the exam**, which is approximately **24-26 questions** out of 85 scored questions (plus some of the 10 unscored questions).

### Is Domain G harder than other domains?
Domain G is often considered the hardest because:
1. It's the largest domain (most content to master)
2. Questions require application, not just recall
3. Many procedures sound similar (DRA vs. DRI vs. DRO)
4. Real-world scenarios have multiple "reasonable" answers

### What's the most tested area in Domain G?
Reinforcement procedures (including schedules, preference assessments, and token economies) and differential reinforcement (DRA, DRI, DRO) appear most frequently.

### Should I memorize exact task list codes?
No. Know the concepts (G-4: Use contingent reinforcement) but don't waste time memorizing "G-4." The exam tests application, not code numbers.

### How do I prepare for Domain G application questions?
1. Practice with scenario-based questions (like this post)
2. Think through real client examples
3. Ask "why" for every answer, not just "what"
4. Take full-length practice exams under timed conditions
