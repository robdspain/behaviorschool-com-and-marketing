## 📝 Notes

### Scope Decisions
- **Backend**: Continue using Next.js API routes instead of FastAPI (simpler for Netlify deployment)
- **Database**: Add Supabase for persistence (already in project)
- **State**: Add Redux if needed, or continue with React state
- **Components**: Add Radix UI gradually for better accessibility
- **Testing**: Add later, focus on features first

### Key Differences from Original
1. **Deployment**: Netlify serverless vs. Docker containers
2. **Database**: Supabase vs. MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite
3. **Backend**: Next.js API routes vs. FastAPI
4. **Simplicity**: Fewer components initially, add as needed

### Success Criteria
- Generate presentations with multiple AI providers
- Support document upload for context
- Export to both PPTX and PDF
- Manage presentation library
- Edit outlines before generation
- Add images and icons to slides
- Professional slide layouts
