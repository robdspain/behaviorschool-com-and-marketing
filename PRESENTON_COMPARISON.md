## 💾 Current Tech Stack vs. Presenton

### Similarities
- ✅ Next.js frontend
- ✅ TypeScript
- ✅ Tailwind CSS
- ✅ API routes architecture
- ✅ Lucide React icons

### Differences
- ❌ No FastAPI backend (using Next.js API routes only)
- ✅ Database via Supabase (replaces localStorage-only)
- ❌ No Docker deployment
- ⚠️ No Redux state management (React state is sufficient so far; can add Redux Toolkit for complex flows)
- ⚠️ Limited Radix UI usage (plan to adopt gradually for a11y primitives)
- ✅ Tiptap rich text editor (blog-grade editor; used for slides modal editor)
- ✅ @dnd-kit drag-and-drop (thumbnail reordering and outline editor)

- ❌ No testing infrastructure

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Priority)
1. ✅ All P0 features complete - PRODUCTION READY
2. ✅ Add table layouts for data-heavy presentations
3. ✅ Implement web search grounding (Google Search API)
4. ✅ Add batch file upload (multiple documents)
5. ✅ Improve template designer (full customization)
6. ✅ Default to Create flow with inline editor (no immediate download)
7. ✅ Slide editor drag-and-drop thumbnails (reorder + save)

2. Implement PPTX upload and processing (import + convert to editable deck)
3. Brand kit/theme import (fonts, logos, colors) + one‑click redesign
4. Web‑native presentation mode + shareable link (viewer)
5. Smart layout suggestions (auto‑redesign within existing slides)
6. Export integration: Google Slides (and plan Keynote)
7. Add direct image upload (in addition to generation)
8. Enhance chart editor (more customization options)
9. Implement webhook notifications

### Long-term Advanced Features
1. Real‑time collaboration (multi‑user), presence, and version history
2. Analytics/engagement module (per‑slide views, time on slide, click tracking)
3. Advanced AI features (tool calls, extended reasoning)
4. Vector database integration (ChromaDB for RAG)
5. Document intelligence and smart summarization
6. Credit/usage model (quotas, metering) for AI and exports
7. Version control for presentations

## 📝 Notes

### Scope Decisions
- **Backend**: Continue using Next.js API routes instead of FastAPI (simpler for Netlify deployment)
- **Database**: Add Supabase for persistence (already in project)
- **State**: Add Redux if needed, or continue with React state
- **Components**: Add Radix UI gradually for better accessibility
- **Testing**: Add later, focus on features first

### Key Differences from Original
1. **Deployment**: Netlify serverless vs. Docker containers
2. **Database**: Supabase vs. MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite
3. **Backend**: Next.js API routes vs. FastAPI
4. **Simplicity**: Fewer components initially, add as needed

### Success Criteria
- Generate presentations with multiple AI providers
- Support document upload for context
- Export to both PPTX and PDF
- Manage presentation library
- Edit outlines before generation
- Add images and icons to slides
- Professional slide layouts
