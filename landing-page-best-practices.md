- Clarify the single goal: one page, one primary action. Remove or minimize navigation and off-path links.
- Ensure message match: align headline and visuals with the ad or source promise.
- Above-the-fold essentials: clear headline, succinct subhead, compelling visual, and a primary CTA.
- Communicate value fast: what it does, who it’s for, how it helps, and outcomes/results.
- Use strong visual hierarchy: contrast, whitespace, and directional cues pointing toward the CTA.
- Showcase proof: testimonials, logos, ratings, metrics (e.g., users, outcomes), and real screenshots.
- Reduce friction: keep forms short; consider multi-step/progressive forms for higher intent.
- Handle objections: short FAQs, guarantees, risk-reversal, and transparent pricing or next steps.
- Mobile-first: thumb-friendly buttons, concise copy, sticky CTA, and simplified sections.
- Performance: optimize images, lazy-load media, and pass Core Web Vitals. Faster pages convert better.
- Accessibility: sufficient color contrast, readable type, descriptive alt text, keyboard focus states.
- Clear CTAs: action-oriented copy (e.g., “Get the guide,” “Start free trial”) and consistent placement.
- Experimentation: A/B test headlines, hero visuals, social proof placement, and form length.
- Analytics: define the primary conversion, set up events, and review funnel, scroll, and click maps.
- Post-conversion: use a thank-you page to confirm, deliver value, upsell, or offer next steps.
