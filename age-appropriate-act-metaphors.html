            <h2>Introduction & Research Foundation</h2>

            <div class="research-highlight">
                <strong>Why Metaphors Work for Children:</strong> Research demonstrates that children think less literally than adults, making metaphors and experiential approaches particularly effective for helping them grasp abstract concepts (Tayyebi et al., 2024). Children naturally engage with figurative language through fables, stories, and imaginative play, making ACT metaphors an ideal therapeutic tool.
            </div>

            <div class="key-principle">
                <strong>Developmental Principle:</strong> Metaphor comprehension follows Piaget's cognitive development stages. The ability to understand metaphors increases steadily with age, with the poorest interpretations showing characteristics of concrete and pre-operational thought, while the best interpretations demonstrate formal operational thinking (Carriedo et al., 2016).
            </div>

            <div class="warning">
                <strong>Important Note:</strong> ACT's concepts, techniques, strategies, and metaphors must be modified to the appropriate developmental, academic, and communication levels of each child or adolescent. One cannot get too abstract or wordy, especially with children under age ten.

            <h2>Early Childhood (Ages 5-7): Preoperational Stage</h2>

            <div class="developmental-stage">
                <strong>Developmental Characteristics:</strong> Limited capacity for abstract thinking, concrete understanding, beginning symbolic representation. Children at this stage benefit from simple, visual, and experiential metaphors that relate to familiar experiences.
            </div>

            <div class="metaphor-card">
                <div class="metaphor-title">1. Weather Inside Me</div>
                <div class="metaphor-description">
                    Emotions are like weather that changes throughout the day. Sometimes we have sunny feelings (happy), sometimes cloudy feelings (sad), and sometimes stormy feelings (angry). Just like weather, our feelings always change.
                </div>
                <div class="implementation-tip">
                    <strong>Implementation:</strong> Use a simple weather chart or draw pictures. Have children identify their current "weather" and remember that all weather passes.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="metaphor-card">
                <div class="metaphor-title">2. Snow Globe Mind</div>
                <div class="metaphor-description">
                    Our minds are like snow globes. When we're upset, it's like someone shook the globe and all the snow (thoughts and feelings) are swirling around. When we sit still and breathe, the snow settles and we can see clearly again.
                </div>
                <div class="implementation-tip">
                    <strong>Implementation:</strong> Use an actual snow globe as a visual aid. Shake it when discussing upset feelings, then watch it settle together.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="metaphor-card">
                <div class="metaphor-title">3. The Pet Thoughts</div>
                <div class="metaphor-description">
                    Thoughts are like pets that visit our mind. Some are friendly puppies (happy thoughts), some are grumpy cats (worried thoughts). We don't have to play with every pet that visits - we can just notice them and choose which ones to pay attention to.
                </div>
                <div class="implementation-tip">
                    <strong>Implementation:</strong> Draw different "pet thoughts" or use stuffed animals to represent different types of thoughts.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="research-highlight">
                <strong>Research Note:</strong> Children at this stage show limited metaphor comprehension but can understand simple comparisons when supported with concrete visuals and experiential activities (Carriedo et al., 2016).

        <div class="age-group">
            <h2>Middle Childhood (Ages 8-11): Concrete Operational Stage</h2>

            <div class="developmental-stage">
                <strong>Developmental Characteristics:</strong> Improved logical thinking, better understanding of cause and effect, increased capacity for metaphorical thinking. Research shows eleven-year-olds demonstrate significantly higher metaphor comprehension than seven-year-olds (Carriedo et al., 2016).
            </div>

            <div class="metaphor-card">
                <div class="metaphor-title">1. Passengers on the Bus</div>
                <div class="metaphor-description">
                    You are the bus driver of your life. Thoughts and feelings are passengers who get on your bus - some are nice, some are mean, some are loud. You can't control which passengers get on, but you're still the driver. You choose where the bus goes, even with difficult passengers aboard.
                </div>
                <div class="implementation-tip">
                    <strong>Implementation:</strong> Role-play being the bus driver. Discuss how to keep driving toward important places (values) even when passengers are being disruptive.

                <div class="metaphor-title">2. Tug of War with Feelings</div>
                <div class="metaphor-description">
                    When we have difficult feelings, it's like being in a tug-of-war. The harder we pull against our feelings (trying to make them go away), the stronger they pull back. What if we just dropped the rope? The feeling might still be there, but we're not fighting it anymore and can focus on what matters to us.
                </div>
                <div class="implementation-tip">
                    <strong>Implementation:</strong> Actually play tug-of-war, then practice "dropping the rope." Discuss how this feels different from struggling.
                </div>

            <div class="metaphor-card">
                <div class="metaphor-title">3. Leaves on a Stream</div>
                <div class="metaphor-description">
                    Imagine sitting by a gentle stream watching leaves float by. Our thoughts are like those leaves - they come and go naturally. We can watch them float past without having to grab onto them or push them away.
                </div>
                <div class="implementation-tip">
                    <strong>Implementation:</strong> Practice the guided imagery exercise. Have children draw thoughts on paper leaves and practice letting them "float by."
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="metaphor-card">
                <div class="metaphor-title">4. The Quicksand Trap</div>
                <div class="metaphor-description">
                    Worrying thoughts are like quicksand. The more we struggle and fight with our worried thoughts, the deeper we sink. But if we stop struggling and stay calm, we can find a way out or call for help.
                </div>
                <div class="implementation-tip">
                    <strong>Implementation:</strong> Demonstrate with kinetic sand or playdough. Show how struggling makes things worse, while staying calm helps us think clearly.

            <div class="developmental-stage">
                <strong>Developmental Characteristics:</strong> Developing abstract thinking, increased self-awareness, beginning formal operational thought. Adolescents can handle more complex metaphors and begin to understand psychological flexibility concepts more deeply.

                <div class="implementation-tip">
                    <strong>Implementation:</strong> Have teens identify which "part" is active in different situations. Practice strengthening the Noticer and connecting with Values.

                <div class="metaphor-description">
                    Thoughts are like clouds in the sky of your mind. Some are light and fluffy (pleasant thoughts), others are dark storm clouds (difficult thoughts). You are the sky - vast, spacious, and unchanging. Clouds come and go, but the sky remains.

                <div class="implementation-tip">
                    <strong>Implementation:</strong> Use cloud-watching exercises or sky photography. Discuss how the sky (true self) is always there, regardless of weather conditions (thoughts/emotions).

                <div class="metaphor-description">
                    Life is full of choice points - moments where you can move toward what you value or away from it. When facing difficult thoughts or feelings, you can choose: Will you move toward your values or let the discomfort control your actions?
                </div>
                <div class="implementation-tip">
                    <strong>Implementation:</strong> Draw choice point diagrams for real-life situations. Practice identifying values-based actions versus avoidance behaviors.

                <div class="metaphor-title">4. The Social Media Mind</div>
                <div class="metaphor-description">
                    Your mind is like a social media feed - constantly showing you posts (thoughts). Some posts are helpful, others are toxic. You can't control what appears in your feed, but you can choose which posts to engage with and which to scroll past.
                </div>
                <div class="implementation-tip">
                    <strong>Implementation:</strong> Relate to teens' digital experience. Discuss "unfollowing" unhelpful thought patterns and "engaging mindfully" with useful thoughts.

                <div class="metaphor-description">
                    Your thoughts and emotions are like chess pieces - some black (difficult), some white (pleasant). You might think you need to win by getting rid of all the black pieces, but you are actually the chessboard itself - stable, observing, unchanged by what pieces are present.

                <div class="implementation-tip">
                    <strong>Implementation:</strong> Use an actual chess board. Discuss how the board (true self) remains constant regardless of the game being played (emotional experiences).

                <div class="metaphor-description">
                    Sometimes life takes you off your planned route through traffic jams (obstacles) or detours (setbacks). Your values are like a GPS that can recalculate - not taking you back to where you were, but finding a new path toward your destination.

                <div class="metaphor-description">
                    Avoiding difficult experiences can become like building a prison. Each avoidance is another bar on the cell. You might feel safe inside, but you're also trapped and can't reach what you value. True freedom comes from learning to open the door and step outside, even when it feels scary.

                <div class="implementation-tip">
                    <strong>Implementation:</strong> Identify personal "avoidance prisons." Discuss gradual steps toward valued actions despite discomfort. Create "freedom plans" for breaking out of avoidance patterns.

                    Your life is like a garden. Values are the seeds you plant, and your actions are how you water and tend them. Difficult thoughts and emotions are like weeds - they'll always grow, but you can choose where to focus your energy: pulling endless weeds or nurturing what you want to grow.

                <div class="implementation-tip">
                    <strong>Implementation:</strong> Create life gardens with values as plants. Discuss daily "gardening actions" and how to tend to what matters most while accepting that weeds (difficulties) will always be present.

            <h2>Implementation Guidelines</h2>

            <div class="key-principle">
                <strong>Key Research Finding:</strong> Children have had less time to adopt entrenched patterns of experiential avoidance, so ACT may operate to achieve both remediation and prevention of psychological inflexibility (Tayyebi et al., 2024).
            </div>

            <h3>General Principles:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Keep it concrete:</strong> Use visual aids, props, and hands-on activities</li>
                <li><strong>Make it active:</strong> Children learn better through movement and experience</li>
                <li><strong>Stay age-appropriate:</strong> Match complexity to developmental stage</li>
                <li><strong>Use repetition:</strong> Reinforce metaphors through multiple exposures</li>
                <li><strong>Encourage creativity:</strong> Let children adapt metaphors to their own experiences</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Adaptation Strategies:</h3>
            <div class="metaphor-card">
                <div class="metaphor-description">
                    <strong>For younger children (5-8):</strong> Use more visual aids, shorter sessions, and familiar concepts (animals, weather, toys)<br><br>
                    <strong>For middle childhood (9-12):</strong> Incorporate more interactive elements, beginning abstract concepts, and real-life applications<br><br>
                    <strong>For adolescents (13-18):</strong> Connect to their world (technology, social media, future goals) and encourage deeper psychological insights
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="warning">
                <strong>Important Considerations:</strong> Always work with important adults (parents, teachers) when implementing ACT metaphors with children. Consider cultural context and individual developmental variations. Some children may need simpler or more complex metaphors regardless of their chronological age.
