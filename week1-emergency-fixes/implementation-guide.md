## Emergency Support Script

If you're using WordPress, here's a quick functions.php addition:

```php
// Add to your theme's functions.php
function update_page_seo_tags() {
    if (is_page('bcba-mock-practice-test')) {
        echo '<title>Free BCBA Mock Exam - 160 Questions with Instant Scoring | Behavior School</title>';
        echo '<meta name="description" content="Take a full-length BCBA mock exam with 160 questions based on the 6th Edition Task List. Get instant scoring, detailed explanations, and performance breakdown by content area. No registration required.">';
    }
    // Add more pages as needed
}
add_action('wp_head', 'update_page_seo_tags', 1);
```

## Questions to Answer Before Implementation:

1. **How many questions does your mock exam actually have?** 
   - Update "160" to your actual number

2. **Is your mock exam truly free?**
   - Only use "Free" if it actually is

3. **Do you require registration?**
   - Update "No registration required" accordingly

4. **What's your unique angle?**
   - Emphasize school-based focus if that's your differentiator

5. **Do you have instant scoring?**
   - Only promise features you actually have
