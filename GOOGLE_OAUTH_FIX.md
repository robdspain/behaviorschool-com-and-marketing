# üö® URGENT FIX: Google OAuth Invalid Client Error

## The Real Problem

You're getting **"Error 401: invalid_client"** from Google, which means:

‚ùå The Google OAuth Client ID in Supabase doesn't exist or has been deleted  
‚ùå Client ID: `72495015027-a0tb4i6ojqth8uv7g39u258jbormkcch.apps.googleusercontent.com`

## Quick Fix (10 minutes)

### Option A: Create New Google OAuth Credentials (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Go to Google Cloud Console
https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

#### Step 2: Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID

1. Click **"+ CREATE CREDENTIALS"** ‚Üí **"OAuth client ID"**

2. **Application type:** Web application

3. **Name:** Behavior School Admin (or any name)

4. **Authorized JavaScript origins:**
   ```
   https://behaviorschool.com
   https://dugolglucuzolzvuqxmi.supabase.co
   ```

5. **Authorized redirect URIs:**
   ```
   https://dugolglucuzolzvuqxmi.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
   ```

6. Click **"CREATE"**

7. **Copy the Client ID and Client Secret** (you'll need these in the next step)

#### Step 3: Add Credentials to Supabase

1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/dugolglucuzolzvuqxmi/auth/providers

2. Find **Google** provider

3. **Enable** the toggle

4. **Paste:**
   - Client ID (from Google Console)
   - Client Secret (from Google Console)

5. Click **"Save"**

#### Step 4: Test Again

1. Wait 2 minutes for changes to propagate
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try: https://behaviorschool.com/admin/login
4. Click "Continue with Google"
5. Should work now! ‚úÖ

### Option B: Find Existing OAuth Credentials

If you already have OAuth credentials but they're not working:

#### Step 1: Check Google Cloud Console
https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

Look for existing OAuth 2.0 Client IDs. If you see one:

1. Click on it
2. Verify **Authorized redirect URIs** includes:
   ```
   https://dugolglucuzolzvuqxmi.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback
   ```
3. If not, add it and save

#### Step 2: Update Supabase

1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com/project/dugolglucuzolzvuqxmi/auth/providers
2. Click on **Google** provider
3. Update Client ID and Client Secret with the correct values
4. Save

## What Happened?

The error message shows Supabase is trying to use this client ID:
```
72495015027-a0tb4i6ojqth8uv7g39u258jbormkcch.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

But Google says: **"The OAuth client was not found"**

This means either:
- The client ID was deleted from Google Cloud Console
- The client ID is from a different Google Cloud project
- The client ID was never created
- The project was deleted or disabled

## Testing the Fix

After completing setup:

```bash
# Wait 2 minutes for propagation
sleep 120

# Clear browser cache (in browser)
# Then test:
```

1. Visit: https://behaviorschool.com/admin/login
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. **Expected:** Google sign-in screen (not error!)
4. Sign in with your Google account
5. Should redirect to `/admin` dashboard

## Verification

After successful login, verify:

```javascript
// In browser console (F12) on /admin page:
console.log('User authenticated:', !!window.supabase)
```

You should see your session data.

## Common Issues After Fix

### Issue: "Access blocked: This app's request is invalid"
**Solution:** OAuth consent screen not configured in Google Cloud Console

### Issue: "Redirect URI mismatch"
**Solution:** Add exact Supabase callback URL to Google Console redirect URIs

### Issue: Still getting "invalid_client"
**Solution:** 
- Verify you copied the correct Client ID and Secret
- Make sure you're using the credentials from the correct Google Cloud project
- Check that the OAuth client wasn't deleted

## Security Notes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit Client Secret to git
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep credentials secure
- ‚úÖ Store in Supabase dashboard only
- ‚úÖ Supabase will not expose the secret
