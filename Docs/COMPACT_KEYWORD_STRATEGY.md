# Compact Keyword Strategy - October 2025

**Goal:** Improve position from 24.9 → 15-20 AND increase CTR from 4.4% → 8-10%

**Analysis Date:** October 19, 2025 (28-day window)
**Current Performance:**
- Average Position: 24.9
- Average CTR: 4.4%
- Total Clicks: 15
- Total Impressions: 348

---

## Core Problem

**Position dropped but CTR improved:**
- Early October: Better position (6-10) but lower CTR (2-3%)
- Late October: Worse position (30-50) but better CTR (4-7% on pages that rank well)

**Root Cause:**
- High-value pages (`/bcba-exam-prep`, `/behavior-study-tools`) are ranking poorly (positions 35-50)
- These pages have massive search volume potential but are invisible in SERPs
- Pages that DO rank well (position 5-10) have good CTR, proving content quality is there

## Title Tag Formula (The Compact Method)

**Structure:**
```
[Free] [Primary Keyword] [Year] | [Specific Benefit] + [Secondary Benefit]
```

**Rules:**
1. **Keep under 60 characters** (mobile display cutoff)
2. **Front-load high-intent modifiers:** "Free" or numbers ("200+")
3. **Include year (2025):** Shows freshness, improves CTR by 12-18%
4. **Use pipe (|) separator:** Cleaner than hyphens, better CTR
5. **Avoid generic words:** "Comprehensive", "Resources", "Tools" (unless part of keyword)

**Examples:**
- ❌ Bad: "Comprehensive BCBA Exam Preparation Resources and Study Materials"
- ✅ Good: "Free BCBA Exam Prep 2025 | Practice Tests + Study Tools"

---

## Meta Description Formula

**Structure:**
```
[Benefit Statement]. [Specific Features (3-4 items)]. [Social Proof or CTA].
```

**Rules:**
1. **155-160 characters max** (desktop display)
2. **First sentence = primary benefit** (front-load value)
3. **Middle = feature list** (use commas, not bullets)
4. **End = credibility or CTA** (social proof > urgency)
5. **Include target keyword** (for bolding in SERPs)

**Examples:**
- ❌ Bad: "We offer exam prep resources for BCBAs including practice tests and study materials."
- ✅ Good: "Beat the 54% BCBA pass rate with unlimited free practice questions, adaptive learning, and school-based scenarios. Join 2,000+ BCBAs who passed."

## Content Expansion Strategy

### Add These Sections to `/bcba-exam-prep`

1. **"2025 BCBA Exam Changes"**
   - Signals freshness
   - Targets year-specific searches
   - 200-300 words

2. **"Free vs. Paid BCBA Exam Prep: Comparison Table"**
   - Targets comparison searches
   - Establishes authority
   - Include competitors (BAS, ABA Wizard, Behave Your Best)

3. **"Study Schedule: 30/60/90 Day Plans"**
   - Targets "how to" intent
   - Practical value = higher engagement time
   - Downloadable PDF = backlink magnet

4. **"Pass Rate Statistics by Study Method"**
   - Data-driven content = backlinks
   - Targets "bcba pass rate" searches (1.2k/month)

---

## Internal Linking Strategy

**Goal:** Pass authority to low-ranking pages

### From High-Authority Pages (Position 1-10)
- **`/` (homepage - position 7.1)** → Add prominent link to `/bcba-exam-prep` above the fold
- **`/bcba-study-tools` (position 3.0)** → Link to `/behavior-study-tools` as "See all study tools"
- **`/behavior-school-launches-ai-powered-bcba-exam-prep-platform` (position 5.0)** → Link to `/bcba-exam-prep` multiple times

### Create Topic Clusters
```
Hub Page: /bcba-exam-prep (position 50 → target 15)
  ↓
Spoke Pages:
  → /free-bcba-mock-practice-test (position 23.7 → target 15)
  → /bcba-practice-exam (position 10.4 → target 8)
  → /behavior-study-tools (position 35.6 → target 20)
```

**Implementation:**
- Add "Related Resources" section to each page
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here")
- Link bidirectionally (hub ↔ spokes)
