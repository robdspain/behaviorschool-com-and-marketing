💡 BCBA Exam Tip: Don't confuse DRA, DRI, and DRO

All three are differential reinforcement procedures, but here's how to remember the difference:

• DRA (Alternative): Same function, different behavior (teach "Can I have that?" instead of grabbing)
• DRI (Incompatible): Physically can't do both (hands in pockets can't hit)
• DRO (Other): Reinforce absence of problem behavior (any behavior EXCEPT the target)

Pro tip: Exam questions love to test these distinctions with realistic scenarios. Practice identifying the function first—that's always your starting point.

### Secondary Hashtags (Content-Specific)

**Exam Prep:**
- `#BCBAExam`
- `#BCBAExamPrep`
- `#BCBAStudy`
- `#BCBAPracticeTest`

- `#BIP`

**General:**

## Posting Schedule

### Weekly Newsletter (Monday 9am)
**Workflow:**
1. Send newsletter via Listmonk
2. Extract key content for social posts

## Automation Workflow

### Current Setup
Your blog editor already has social auto-posting functionality at:
- File: `src/app/api/admin/blog/social-post/route.ts` (likely exists based on editor code)

### Manual Process (Until Full Automation)

1. **When Publishing Blog Post:**
   - Copy URL of published post
   - Use templates above
   - Customize for platform (LinkedIn vs Twitter)
   - Schedule posts via platform native schedulers

2. **Weekly Newsletter:**
   - Create in Listmonk using HTML template
   - After sending, manually post to social
   - Track clicks from each platform

### Full Automation (Future Enhancement)
Consider integrating:
- **Buffer** or **Hootsuite** - Schedule posts in advance
- **Zapier** - Connect Listmonk → Social platforms
- **Custom API** - Auto-post when blog publishes
