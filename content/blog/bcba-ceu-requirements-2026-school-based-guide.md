> **AI Disclosure:** This article was drafted with AI assistance and reviewed for accuracy against current BACB documentation. All BACB requirements should be verified at [bacb.com](https://www.bacb.com) before making certification decisions.

## The Short Answer

BCBAs must earn **32 CEUs every two years**. Of those:

- **4 CEUs** must be in ethics (every cycle)
- **3 CEUs** must be in supervision (if you supervise — increases to 4 in 2027)
- **2 CEUs** in cultural responsiveness (new requirement)
- Remaining units can be general behavior-analytic content

No carryover allowed. All 32 must be earned in the current cycle.

If you're a school-based BCBA who supervises RBTs or BCBA candidates — which most of you are — you're navigating multiple required content areas on top of a full caseload. This guide breaks it all down.

## What Are CEUs and Why Do They Matter?

Continuing Education Units (CEUs) are the BACB's mechanism for ensuring that behavior analysts stay current with the field. One CEU equals one hour of approved instruction or learning activity.

Unlike some professional licenses where "any training" counts, BCBA CEUs must come from **BACB-approved Authorized Continuing Education (ACE) providers**. That matters — not every webinar, conference session, or university course qualifies unless the provider holds ACE status.

Behavior School LLC holds ACE Provider status (ACE #: OP-25-11420). That means our [continuing education offerings](https://behaviorschool.com/bacb-ace-provider) count toward your recertification requirements.

## BCBA CEU Requirements: Full 2026 Breakdown

### Total CEUs Required: 32

Every BCBA must complete 32 CEUs during each 2-year recertification cycle. These begin on your certification or recertification anniversary date — not on January 1.

### Mandatory CEU Categories

| Category | 2025–2026 Requirement | 2027 Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| **Ethics** | 4 CEUs | 4 CEUs |
| **Supervision** (supervisors only) | 3 CEUs | 4 CEUs |
| **Cultural Responsiveness** | 2 CEUs | 2 CEUs |
| **General / Other** | Remaining hours | Remaining hours |

#### Ethics CEUs (4 Required)

As of March 2025, the BACB expanded the definition of ethics CEUs. Ethics continuing education now includes:

- Content related to BACB ethics requirements and/or the BACB Ethics Code
- Content addressing the ethical dimensions of ABA practice in any setting

This is broader than it used to be — ethical decision-making in school-based practice, navigating consent with minors, managing dual relationships in educational settings, and professional conduct with school teams all qualify under the right ACE provider framing.

#### Supervision CEUs (3–4 Required if You Supervise)

If you provide BACB-approved supervision to RBTs or BCBA/BCaBA trainees, you must complete supervision-focused CEUs. This requirement increases from 3 to 4 CEUs beginning in 2027.

For school-based BCBAs, this is almost always relevant. If you're supervising any staff — even informally — check whether they are accumulating BACB-trackable hours. If so, you need supervision CEUs.

#### Cultural Responsiveness CEUs (2 Required)

The BACB requires 2 CEUs addressing cultural responsiveness per cycle. In school settings, this intersects naturally with culturally sustaining practices, multilingual learners, and racially equitable behavior assessment — areas worth choosing intentionally rather than checking a box.

## How the 2-Year Cycle Works

Your recertification cycle runs for exactly two years from your certification or last recertification date. It does **not** reset on a calendar year.

**Example:** If your certification date is April 14, 2025, your current cycle ends April 13, 2027. All 32 CEUs must be completed within that window.

### Submission Window

The BACB typically opens a submission window 60 days before your cycle end date. You don't submit during the cycle — you report completion at the end.

**Key practical point:** Many school BCBAs scramble to complete CEUs in March and April when they're also buried in IEP season. Plan your CEU completion at the beginning of your cycle, not the end.

## Free BCBA CEUs: What Actually Counts

There are legitimate free CEU sources — but quality and applicability vary. Here's an honest assessment:

### High-Quality Free Sources

**ABA Inside Track Podcast**
Selected episodes offer free CEUs. The host identifies eligible episodes and provides a quiz/attestation process through an ACE provider. Relevant for school practitioners when episodes cover school-based or educational ABA topics.

**Behavior Analyst Online (BAO)**
Peer-reviewed journal with CE options. Some articles include free or low-cost CEUs directly through the publication.

**BACB Free Resources**
The BACB publishes free ethics and supervision resources periodically. Check their [continuing education page](https://www.bacb.com) for current offerings.

**Behavior School (Free Options)**
As an ACE provider, Behavior School offers select free and low-cost CEUs specifically designed for school-based practitioners. Check [our ACE provider page](/bacb-ace-provider) for current offerings. These are built for school contexts — FBA documentation, behavior support planning, and supervision in educational settings.

### What Doesn't Count

- General education conferences that aren't ACE-approved (even if behavior-related)
- University coursework outside of an ACE-approved program
- "Informational" webinars without BACB attestation tracking
- Reading research articles (unless attached to a formal CEU quiz through an ACE provider)

## School-Based BCBA: CEU Planning That Actually Fits Your Calendar

The school year creates predictable crunch periods that make CEU planning critical. Here's a framework:

### The School BCBA CEU Calendar

**Summer (June–August) — High Opportunity**
This is your prime CEU window. Conferences (like CalABA, ABAI, state ABA associations), university intensives, and online courses are all available. Target 12–16 CEUs here.

**Fall Semester (September–December) — Moderate**
Manageable pace. Aim for 1 CEU per month through podcasts, webinars, and journal-based CE. Ethics and supervision CEUs integrate naturally into your existing supervision meetings if structured correctly.

**Winter Break (December–January)**
A second mini-window. Good for batching 4–6 CEUs across a week or two.

**Spring Semester (January–May) — Protect Your Time**
IEP season, annual reviews, transition planning — this is your busiest period. Do not rely on this window for significant CEU completion. Finish your required categories (ethics, supervision) before spring.

### Recommended Completion Timeline (2-Year Cycle)

| Period | CEU Target | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Summer Year 1 | 12–14 CEUs | General content, supervision |
| Fall Year 1 | 4–6 CEUs | Ethics, cultural responsiveness |
| Spring Year 1 | 2–4 CEUs | Supervision (finish requirement) |
| Summer Year 2 | 6–8 CEUs | General content, fill gaps |
| Final 3 Months | 0–4 CEUs | Buffer only; don't start here |

## Documenting Your CEUs: Avoid the Common Mistakes

### What to Keep

For every CEU completed, maintain:
- Provider name and ACE provider number
- Course title and date completed
- Certificate of completion (PDF preferred)
- Number of CEUs awarded

The BACB may audit your records. Organize these by cycle in a cloud folder or use the BACB's Gateway tracking system to log completions as you earn them.

### Don't Wait to Log

School BCBAs who complete a conference in June often forget to log it by October. Get into the habit of logging within 48 hours of completion.

### The Gateway System

The BACB's online portal (Gateway) is where you track hours, manage your recertification, and submit at the end of your cycle. Many ACE providers now report completions directly to Gateway on your behalf — confirm this with each provider so you're not double-logging.

## What Changes in 2027

The BACB announced changes effective for recertification cycles that include or begin after January 1, 2027:

- **Supervision CEU requirement increases from 3 to 4** for practicing supervisors
- **Ethics CEU definition** remains expanded (as updated in March 2025)
- **ACE Provider requirements** are also changing as of July 1, 2026 — providers must meet new standards, which may affect which sources remain eligible

If your recertification cycle extends into 2027, the newer requirements may apply to part or all of your current cycle. Check the BACB's [upcoming changes documentation](https://www.bacb.com/authorized-continuing-education-providers/) for specifics.

## School-Based CEU Topics Worth Prioritizing

Not all CEUs are created equal. Beyond compliance, choose topics that have immediate payoff in your school setting:

1. **Supervision in school contexts** — managing supervision ratios across multiple sites, indirect vs. direct supervision, documentation in educational settings
2. **Ethics in school practice** — consent with minors, FERPA intersections, reporting obligations, competing stakeholder interests
3. **Trauma-informed behavior assessment** — expanding your FBA lens beyond function
4. **MTSS/PBIS leadership** — positioning yourself as a systems-level contributor, not just a case manager
5. **Cultural responsiveness in behavior assessment** — valid for required cultural responsiveness CEUs, and genuinely relevant in diverse school communities
6. **ACT and acceptance-based approaches** — increasingly relevant for staff support, student self-regulation, and school psychology collaboration

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I carry over unused CEUs to my next cycle?**
No. The BACB does not allow carryover. All 32 CEUs must be earned within your current 2-year cycle.

**I didn't supervise anyone this cycle — do I still need supervision CEUs?**
If you held no BACB-approved supervisory relationship during your cycle, supervision CEUs are not required. However, if you provided any fieldwork supervision — even informally — verify whether those supervisees were accumulating hours toward BCBA/RBT certification.

**Do university courses count?**
Graduate coursework through a BACB-approved program can count in some contexts, but most traditional university courses do not qualify as CEUs unless they are delivered through an ACE-certified program. Check with your university's behavior analysis department for specifics.

**What happens if I miss my recertification deadline?**
Your certification lapses. You will be required to apply for reinstatement, which involves additional requirements and fees. There is no grace period.

**Does attending an IEP meeting count as a CEU?**
No. Professional meetings, case conferences, and day-to-day practice do not qualify as CEUs regardless of how educational they may be.

**Are there CEUs specifically for school-based practice?**
Yes — Behavior School offers ACE-approved CEUs built specifically for school settings. See our [ACE provider page](/bacb-ace-provider) for current course offerings.
