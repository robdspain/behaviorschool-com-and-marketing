# How to Find a BCBA Supervisor: A Practical Guide for Aspiring BCBAs

Finding a qualified BCBA supervisor is one of the most common challenges that aspiring BCBAs face — and one of the least well-supported parts of the credentialing process. You have the coursework requirements laid out clearly. You have the fieldwork hour requirements documented by the BACB. But finding an actual human being who is both qualified and willing to supervise you is largely left up to you.

This guide is for people who are stuck at that step.

## Why Finding a BCBA Supervisor Is Hard

The short answer is that there is no central matching system that actually works.

The demand for BCBA supervision has grown significantly as the field has expanded. More people are entering BCBA coursework programs every year. The supply of supervisors who are actively accepting new supervisees has not kept pace.

This creates real problems for aspiring BCBAs — particularly those in underserved regions, those pursuing school-based pathways, or those working in settings that do not have an existing BCBA infrastructure.

### The workforce pipeline problem

Many aspiring BCBAs are working as RBTs or behavior technicians in clinical or school settings. Whether their employer has a qualified supervisor willing to provide structured fieldwork supervision varies enormously. Some organizations actively invest in growing their own supervisors. Others have no interest in supporting staff through the credentialing process.

### Geographic limitations

In rural and suburban areas, the density of practicing BCBAs is much lower. Finding a supervisor who is both local and accepting supervisees is genuinely difficult. Remote supervision is permitted under BACB requirements (within specified limits), but not every supervisor offers remote sessions, and not every setting is appropriate for remote oversight.

## What the BACB Registry Can and Cannot Do

The BACB maintains a certificant registry that is publicly searchable. You can look up whether a specific person holds a current BCBA credential and whether their certification is in good standing.

What the registry cannot tell you:
- Whether someone is currently accepting supervisees
- What populations or settings they have experience with
- Whether they have the time, capacity, or interest in providing quality supervision
- What their supervision style or approach is
- Whether they are a good fit for your learning needs

The registry is a verification tool, not a matching tool. Using it to cold-contact BCBAs in your area — while sometimes effective — requires significant effort and produces inconsistent results.

## What to Look for in a BCBA Supervisor

Not every qualified BCBA is an effective supervisor. The BACB requires supervisors to complete the 8-hour supervision training, but this is a floor, not a ceiling.

When evaluating a potential supervisor, consider:

### Experience in your target setting

If you want to work in schools, you want a supervisor with direct experience in school-based practice. If you want to work in home-based ABA, look for someone with that background. The skills and systems are different enough that setting-specific experience matters.

### Active caseload and professional engagement

A supervisor who is actively practicing is more likely to provide relevant, current guidance. Someone who became a BCBA several years ago but has moved into an administrative role or changed fields may be less current on the clinical content you need to develop.

### Availability and structure

How many supervisees does this person currently have? How many hours can they commit to your supervision each week? What does their supervision look like — is it structured, with documented feedback and skill-building activities, or is it primarily case consultations?

The BACB requires that supervisors deliver at least 5% of your supervised experience hours as actual supervision contact. For candidates accumulating fieldwork hours at a typical rate, this translates to meaningful time commitments from the supervisor. Find out upfront whether they can honor that commitment.

### Alignment on learning goals

Supervision is a professional development relationship, not just a compliance requirement. The best supervisors have a structured approach to developing supervisee competencies across the full BCBA Task List — not just the content areas that come up naturally in your day-to-day work.

### Willingness to provide critical feedback

Look for a supervisor who will tell you when your clinical reasoning is off, when your documentation needs work, and when your behavior in a client interaction needs to change. A supervisor who only validates is not developing you.

## Where to Actually Find a BCBA Supervisor

Beyond the BACB registry, here are approaches that tend to be more productive:

**University programs.** If you are enrolled in a verified course sequence, your program should have a network of approved supervisors. Many programs maintain practicum placements with embedded supervision. Start with your program coordinator.

**Professional organizations.** State and regional ABA organizations — California Association for Behavior Analysis, New England ABA, and others — often have job boards and member directories that can help identify local BCBAs. Some organizations also facilitate supervision matching.

**LinkedIn and professional networks.** Many BCBAs indicate whether they are accepting supervisees in their profiles or post about availability. This approach works better than cold outreach to the BACB registry because you can see context about the person before reaching out.

**Your current employer.** If you are working in a setting that employs BCBAs, start internally. Even if no one in your organization is currently supervising, expressing your interest in pursuing credentialing may open a conversation. Some employers will bring on a contracted supervisor or support staff in developing that capability.

**Supervision marketplaces.** A small number of platforms are building infrastructure to match aspiring BCBAs with qualified supervisors. These are newer, but they address the matching problem more directly than the BACB registry.

## Finding a Supervisor at supervision.behaviorschool.com

The supervision marketplace at [supervision.behaviorschool.com](https://supervision.behaviorschool.com) connects aspiring BCBAs with supervisors across settings, including school-based practice. Supervisors in the marketplace have active BCBA credentials and have indicated capacity to take on new supervisees.

If you are struggling to find supervision, or if you are a practicing BCBA who is available to supervise, the marketplace is designed to make the matching process easier.

## A Note on What You Deserve from Supervision

BCBA supervision is a significant commitment — of your time, your effort, and often your money. You deserve supervision that actually develops your clinical skills, not supervision that exists only to satisfy the hour requirement.

Ask direct questions before committing to a supervisory relationship. What will your sessions look like? How will competencies be assessed? What happens if your progress is not on track? A supervisor who cannot answer these questions clearly is a supervision relationship worth reconsidering.

Your credentialing process is important. The supervision you receive during it shapes the kind of clinician you become.
