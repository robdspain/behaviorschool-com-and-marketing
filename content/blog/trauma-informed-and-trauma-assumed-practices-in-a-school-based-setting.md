## Introduction

Trauma is increasingly recognized as a pervasive public health issue. Research from the National Center for PTSD indicates that approximately 60% of men and 50% of women in the United States experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetime ([PTSD.va.gov](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/treat/specific/ptsd_research_women.asp)).

Trauma is not limited to a specific diagnosis. Beyond the narrow criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), researchers have identified adverse childhood experiences (ACEs)-events such as abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction-that can disrupt development. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 61% of adults have experienced at least one ACE and 16% have experienced four or more ([CDC ACEs](https://www.cdc.gov/aces/about/index.html)).

Trauma triggers neurobiological stress responses; repeated activation can alter brain structures involved in learning, memory, and emotion regulation. Because behavior analysts routinely support individuals with developmental disabilities or social-emotional needs-populations at elevated risk for trauma exposure-a trauma-informed approach is ethically imperative.
While trauma-informed care has become embedded in other helping professions, it has been largely absent from applied behavior analysis (ABA). Research surveys of Board-Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs) have found that most respondents view training on trauma as extremely important, yet the majority report little to no coursework or supervised experience related to trauma. This knowledge gap exists despite the high prevalence of trauma among clients served by behavior analysts and the ethical requirement to protect clients from harm.

Recent scholarship has argued that failing to incorporate trauma-informed care may be detrimental not only to public perception of ABA but also to the effectiveness of assessment and treatment. A proposed framework for trauma-informed behavior analysis centers around four core commitments: acknowledging trauma, ensuring safety and trust, promoting choice and shared governance, and emphasizing skill building.

This article examines the conceptual foundations of trauma-informed behavior analysis, discusses how ABA can operationalize these four commitments, and demonstrates how evidence-based models such as Practical Functional Assessment (PFA) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) align with trauma-informed principles in school settings.
## Defining Trauma and Its Impact on Behavior

SAMHSA defines trauma as exposure to an event or series of events that is experienced as physically or emotionally harmful or life-threatening and that has lasting adverse effects on functioning. Trauma can occur at any age and includes not only dramatic events (e.g., accidents, violence, disasters) but also prolonged exposures such as poverty, bullying, or systemic discrimination. Individuals may respond differently to the same event; some develop resilience while others experience persistent challenges.

Trauma can produce enduring behavioral patterns. A history of physical abuse, for example, may condition mild physical prompts as aversive, leading to severe problem behavior when staff attempt to guide a student. Trauma can also foster avoidance strategies that impede learning. Ignoring trauma history may lead practitioners to implement restrictive procedures (e.g., physical guidance, time-out) that inadvertently replicate past trauma and risk retraumatization. Behavior analysts must therefore assume a universal sensitivity to trauma and err on the side of caution during assessment and intervention.
## Why Trauma-Informed Practice is Essential in ABA

### Prevalence and Ethical Considerations

The high prevalence of trauma among the general population and among people with developmental disabilities implies that behavior analysts are likely to encounter clients with trauma histories. Trauma influences behavior in ways that may not be apparent in a standard functional assessment; avoidance, hypervigilance, or emotional dysregulation may appear as noncompliance or aggression.

Failing to consider trauma not only undermines treatment effectiveness but may violate the ethical mandate to do no harm and to minimize risk. The Behavior Analyst Certification Board's ethics code requires practitioners to prioritize client welfare, use the least restrictive procedures, and seek informed consent-responsibilities that align with trauma-informed care principles.

When ABA practitioners ignore trauma, they risk using extinction, punishment, or physical restraint that may recreate prior trauma. Research has shown that delivering corrective feedback without trauma-assumed practices can lead to escalating challenging behavior. Integrating trauma-assumed approaches-including performance-based functional analysis and graduated exposure-can reduce challenging behavior and increase tolerance for corrective feedback.
The Trauma Piece
Many school teams-whether you're a psychologist, behavior analyst, teacher, or administrator-share a common sticking point: defining "psychological trauma" in practical, behavior-observable terms.

The term often comes wrapped in medical or clinical language, which can clash with day-to-day data collection and intervention models used in schools.

When the construct itself feels murky, it becomes tough to agree on how to identify trauma-related behaviors, choose appropriate measures, or decide when outside supports are needed.
That uncertainty feeds into a second roadblock: professional hesitancy.

Staff may worry about stepping outside their scope, triggering liability concerns, or accidentally retraumatizing a student.

Even seasoned practitioners sometimes default to "let's avoid the trauma piece" rather than risk missteps.

Finally, schools rarely have a clear, systematic framework that ties trauma-informed care (TIC) to existing behavior-analytic or multi-tiered systems of support.

Without procedures that spell out how to blend safety, choice, and skill-building into functional assessment and intervention, teams are left improvising-often with inconsistent results.

Building shared definitions, confidence, and structured protocols is therefore essential if schools want to address trauma's impact on learning and behavior effectively.
## The Four Core Commitments of Trauma-Informed Behavior Analysis

Trauma-informed behavior analysis rests on four core commitments that adapt trauma-informed care principles to ABA practice. Each commitment resonates with behavior analytic principles but requires deliberate operationalization.

### 1. Acknowledge Trauma and Its Potential Impact

Acknowledging trauma entails assuming that many clients have experienced adverse events and that these histories can affect current behavior. Behavior analysts should gather trauma histories when available, review medical and educational records, and consider the context in which problem behavior occurs. Practitioners should recognize that challenging behaviors may be adaptive responses to past trauma.

From a behavior analytic perspective, trauma-related responding can be conceptualized as stimulus control exerted by environmental cues reminiscent of past trauma. For example, a student who has experienced seclusion as punishment may exhibit escape responses during time-out, even when used neutrally. Best practice recommends exercising caution and avoiding intrusive procedures until more information is gathered, using less restrictive alternatives such as noncontingent reinforcement or differential reinforcement without extinction.
In practice, acknowledging trauma may require modifying assessment procedures. Traditional functional analyses present evocative events and withdraw reinforcers repeatedly, which can replicate past trauma and evoke severe problem behavior. Recent developments in functional analysis methodology have produced trauma-informed alternatives, such as the performance-based Interview-Informed Synthesized Contingency Analysis (IISCA), a brief functional analysis that incorporates trauma-assumed measures such as indices of calm and reinforces precursor behaviors to avoid escalation.

Research has demonstrated that trauma-assumed functional analyses can efficiently identify treatment functions and inform effective interventions without extended exposure to evocative conditions. These approaches synthesize suspected reinforcers, include measures of calm, and allow immediate reinforcement of precursor behaviors-modifications that reduce escalation and risk. These examples illustrate how acknowledging trauma can inform safer assessment practices.
### 2. Ensure Safety and Trust

The second commitment emphasizes creating environments that are free from harm and emotionally safe, with predictable, respectful interactions. Safety is not merely the absence of physical danger; it includes emotional safety and trust. From a behavioral standpoint, safety signals are environmental cues associated with the absence of aversive stimulation, while uncertainty can produce anxiety. Trust involves a history of reinforcement for approaching practitioners and freely communicating needs.

ABA ethics codes already require minimizing risk, selecting the least restrictive procedures, and avoiding harmful practices. Yet emotional safety and trust have received less attention and should be prioritized alongside physical safety.

Operationalizing safety and trust involves pairing procedures and rapport building. Research has shown that pairing staff with positive reinforcement before introducing demands can reduce avoidance and build trust. In practice, therapists should invest time in rapport building, provide consistent and respectful interactions, and avoid sudden changes in routines. When interventions require physical guidance or restraint, practitioners should continuously assess emotional responses and have plans for immediate termination if distress occurs.

Performance-based analyses and practical functional assessments (PFAs) often start with a control condition in which the client receives continuous access to preferred stimuli and no demands. This context establishes safety signals and trust before any evocative events are introduced.
### 3. Promote Choice and Shared Governance

Trauma can involve experiences of powerlessness and lack of control. Providing choice helps clients regain a sense of control, reduces the likelihood of retraumatization, and increases participation. Behavior analysis has a rich history of studying choice and preference, recognizing that choice is a fundamental variable in operant behavior.

Arranging opportunities for clients to make choices-from selecting preferred activities to choosing between intervention options-embodies respect for autonomy and aligns with ethical codes. Shared governance extends choice by ensuring that clients and stakeholders have an equal voice in treatment decisions. Social validity assessments should occur not only at the end of treatment but throughout the process, with clients' preferences guiding goal selection and intervention procedures.

Research demonstrates the value of incorporating choice in interventions. Studies have shown that clients consistently prefer intervention packages that include opportunities for functional communication and reinforcement. In practical functional assessments (PFAs), the use of open-ended interviews ensures that caregivers and clients contribute to identifying contexts and reinforcers. Skill-based treatment (SBT) derived from the assessment includes continuous choice-making, with the learner selecting activities, responses, and reinforcement options.

Similarly, the Check-In/Check-Out (CICO) procedure, a Tier 2 school-based intervention, can be modified to align with trauma-informed principles by pairing the student with a trusted mentor and providing conversations that support safety, choice, and empowerment.
### 4. Emphasize Skill Building

The final commitment, emphasizing skill building, aligns closely with the behavior analytic mission. Behavior analysts are uniquely positioned to make meaningful contributions to trauma-informed care because of their expertise in teaching functional skills. Most problem behaviors involve either skill deficits (missing communication, tolerance, or self-management skills) or behavioral excesses (challenging behavior maintained by reinforcement). Therefore, interventions should focus on teaching alternative skills rather than merely suppressing problem behavior.

Behavior analysts using a trauma-informed lens should prioritize differential reinforcement of alternative behaviors, functional communication training, and self-management strategies over extinction or punishment.

Practical Functional Assessment and Skill-Based Treatment (PFA/SBT) exemplify this commitment. After identifying synthesized contingencies, SBT teaches a three-component response sequence: (1) functional communication (asking for the synthesized reinforcer), (2) tolerance (accepting delay or denial while engaging in a coping response), and (3) cooperation (completing contextually appropriate tasks).

Research has demonstrated that PFA/SBT can reduce severe problem behavior and teach communication, tolerance, and cooperation efficiently. Adaptations of this model have included token systems with task choice and graduated exposure to corrective feedback, with skill-building procedures increasing tolerance and maintaining effects when generalized to caregivers. These examples show how focusing on skills can empower clients, enhance resilience, and promote long-term adaptation.
## Integration of PFA and ACT in School-Based Settings

### Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a third-wave behavioral therapy grounded in relational frame theory. Unlike traditional cognitive-behavioral approaches that seek to modify the content of thoughts, ACT aims to increase psychological flexibility-the ability to remain in contact with the present moment and pursue valued actions despite unpleasant internal events.

ACT teaches clients to accept painful thoughts and emotions rather than avoid them and to commit to behavior aligned with their values. The goal is not to reduce unwanted private events but to modify avoidance strategies and align behavior with values. Therapists use metaphors and mindfulness exercises to help clients observe their thoughts and feelings without attachment. ACT recognizes that humans encounter pain and trauma; suffering arises when individuals become stuck in unhelpful strategies to control internal experiences. By promoting psychological flexibility, ACT helps individuals manage the impacts of trauma.

### Evidence for ACT with Youth

Although ACT was initially developed for adults, research supports its use with adolescents. A randomized controlled pilot study with 89 high school students compared an ACT intervention to a control group. Six weekly sessions focused on mindfulness, emotional regulation, and self-compassion ([Büyüköksüz, 2025, BMC Psychology](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11688853/)). Students receiving ACT demonstrated significant improvements in resilience and self-compassion and reductions in psychological inflexibility relative to controls. These findings suggest that ACT may enhance resilience in non-clinical adolescents, a protective factor for trauma.

In school-based case reports, ACT combined with Check-In/Check-Out has been used to support students with learning disabilities and histories of trauma. ACT helped students process painful experiences, align behavior with values, and increase emotional stability. The CICO procedure was modified to include conversations supporting safety, trust, choice, and empowerment. Together, ACT and CICO improved academic engagement, emotional stability, and quality of life for participants.
### Synergy Between ACT and PFA/SBT

ACT and PFA/SBT share complementary goals. Both models emphasize acceptance, choice, and skill building rather than suppression. PFA teaches clients to request reinforcers, tolerate delays, and cooperate with tasks; ACT teaches clients to accept internal experiences and commit to valued actions.

Integrating ACT into PFA can enhance coping skills and psychological flexibility, improving the effectiveness of SBT and reducing relapse. For example, the relaxation and mindfulness techniques from ACT can be incorporated into the tolerance component of SBT to help students remain calm during delays or corrective feedback. Likewise, ACT metaphors can support value clarification, guiding the selection of meaningful replacement behaviors.

Research on trauma-assumed performance-based functional analyses and SBT already emphasizes building tolerance and coping skills; ACT provides a framework for teaching these skills explicitly. In school-based settings, combining ACT with PFA and CICO offers a comprehensive, trauma-informed intervention that addresses both external contingencies and internal experiences.

## Supporting Students Who Struggle with Corrective Feedback

Many educators and behavior analysts encounter students who respond to corrective feedback with frustration, avoidance, or even dangerous behavior. For some students, especially those with a history of emotional dysregulation or adverse experiences, even a mild correction can escalate quickly. Recent research offers valuable insight into how we can approach this issue using trauma-assumed practices grounded in behavior analysis.

Research with students who engage in escalating problem behavior when receiving corrective feedback has shown the value of performance-based functional analysis approaches. These methods allow practitioners to assess the function of behavior without needing to evoke it fully. Importantly, they assume trauma-even when no formal trauma history is confirmed-and adapt the entire assessment and treatment process accordingly.

### Graduated Exposure to Corrective Feedback

One critical recommendation is to teach tolerance to corrective feedback gradually. This involves using graduated exposure, starting with neutral or mild corrections and slowly increasing intensity over time. This approach is paired with reinforcement for calm, appropriate responses to feedback-"tolerance behaviors" such as remaining seated, using appropriate language, or asking for clarification. Students earn tokens and praise for demonstrating these behaviors, which helps build resilience over time.

### Choice and Predictability

Choice and predictability are essential features of trauma-informed interventions. Students should be given opportunities to select tasks, decide when to begin, and opt out temporarily if overwhelmed. Visual schedules and preview statements ("Can I give you a quick suggestion?") help increase emotional safety by reducing the unpredictability of feedback. These small changes give students a sense of control, which reduces the likelihood of escalation.

### Caregiver Training and Generalization

Caregiver training and generalization are powerful elements of effective intervention. After initial success in school or clinic settings, teams should work with caregivers to transfer treatment to home environments. By coaching caregivers on how to build rapport, deliver feedback gently, and reinforce appropriate responses, practitioners extend the benefits of intervention beyond the school or clinic walls.

Ultimately, students who struggle with feedback don't need more punishment or tighter control-they need safer, more flexible systems that assume emotional sensitivity and support gradual learning. By embedding trauma-assumed practices into functional assessment and treatment, we can help students learn to receive feedback in ways that are emotionally safe, socially valid, and instructionally effective.

## Operationalizing the Commitments in School-Based Settings

### Universal Precautions and Tiered Supports

Trauma-informed care adopts universal precautions-assuming all clients may have trauma histories and proactively designing services to mitigate retraumatization. In schools, this approach aligns with Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS), where Tier 1 strategies create safe and supportive environments for all students, and Tier 2/3 interventions provide more intensive support.

Under universal precautions, school staff use compassionate communication, avoid punitive or coercive strategies, and implement predictable routines and clear expectations. Teachers can embed calming activities, choice boards, and opportunities for students to practice functional communication across the day. When problems occur, staff assume that behaviors may be trauma-related and respond with empathy and support rather than judgment.

### Building Therapeutic Relationships

Trauma-informed ABA requires deliberate rapport building. Practitioners should allocate initial sessions to pairing with positive reinforcement, engaging in activities the student chooses, and avoiding demands. Throughout intervention, they should continue to provide reinforcement for approach responses and communication, maintain predictable schedules, and avoid abrupt transitions.

When delivering demands or corrective feedback, practitioners should prepare the student with pre-teaching, use a warm and supportive tone, and check in about feelings. Tools such as Zones of Regulation charts or body scans can help students identify and communicate their emotional states.

### Emphasizing Choice and Collaboration

School-based teams should design interventions collaboratively with students and their caregivers. During interviews and assessments, ask open-ended questions about what triggers and alleviates the student's problem behavior, their preferences and values, and any history of trauma. Use this information to create intervention plans and select reinforcers that are meaningful to the student.

Throughout treatment, incorporate frequent choice-making: the student may choose the order of tasks, the materials used, or the type of reinforcement. When implementing ACT interventions, incorporate values clarification exercises that help students identify what matters to them (e.g., relationships, learning, creativity), and embed these values into treatment goals. Use behavior contracts that specify mutually agreed-upon goals and conditions, reflecting shared governance.
### Building Skills to Foster Resilience

Skill building should address both external behaviors and internal coping processes. In PFA/SBT, teach functional communication (e.g., requesting breaks, help, or access to preferred items), tolerance (e.g., waiting, accepting alternative activities), and cooperation (e.g., following instructions, completing tasks).

Use visual supports, social stories, and video modeling to teach expectations. Reinforce successive approximations and celebrate effort. Integrate self-management strategies such as goal setting, self-monitoring, and self-reinforcement.

When combining behavioral approaches with ACT principles, incorporate mindfulness exercises and defusion techniques to help students notice thoughts and emotions without acting on them. Teach values-based decision making so students can choose behaviors aligned with what matters to them. For example, a student may learn to tolerate a homework assignment by reminding themselves that completing schoolwork aligns with their value of graduating and helping their family.

### Staff Training and Reflection

Implementing trauma-informed ABA requires systematic professional development. Training should cover the definition and prevalence of trauma, the four core commitments, assessment adaptations, rapport-building strategies, and skill-building procedures.

Staff should practice trauma-sensitive communication, learn to recognize signs of stress and dysregulation, and develop plans for de-escalation. Ongoing supervision should include reflection on how interventions may affect students with trauma. Encourage staff to seek feedback from students and families and to adjust practices accordingly.

Additionally, staff should practice self-care to prevent compassion fatigue; regular debriefings, peer support, and mindfulness exercises can help sustain trauma-informed practice.
## Conclusion and Future Directions

Trauma-informed behavior analysis is not a separate intervention but a framework that informs all aspects of assessment and treatment. By acknowledging trauma, ensuring safety and trust, promoting choice and shared governance, and emphasizing skill building, behavior analysts can provide compassionate, effective services that respect clients' histories and foster resilience.

Evidence from recent studies supports the viability of trauma-assumed functional analyses and skill-based treatments. ACT offers complementary strategies to enhance psychological flexibility and resilience, and case reports demonstrate that integrating ACT with school-based interventions can improve academic engagement and emotional well-being.

However, research remains nascent. Future studies should evaluate trauma-informed interventions across diverse populations, explore how to measure emotional safety and trust, and examine long-term outcomes. Training programs must incorporate trauma-informed content to close current knowledge gaps.

By committing to trauma-informed principles, behavior analysts can better serve clients, advance the science of behavior, and contribute to a more compassionate and effective educational system.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Trauma-Informed ABA

### What does "trauma-assumed" mean in school settings?

Trauma-assumed practice means assuming that challenging behavior may be trauma-related without requiring disclosure or diagnosis. Instead of asking "What's wrong with this student?" ask "What happened to this student?" and design interventions accordingly—emphasizing safety, choice, predictability, and relationship.

### How is trauma-informed ABA different from traditional ABA?

Trauma-informed ABA prioritizes psychological safety, offers choices, avoids triggering stimuli, builds trust before demands, and recognizes that behavior may serve a protective function related to past trauma. It still uses functional assessment and evidence-based interventions, but with a trauma lens.

### Can I implement trauma-informed practices without knowing a student's trauma history?

Absolutely. Trauma-assumed practices (offering choice, building relationship, providing warnings/transitions, honoring escape requests) benefit ALL students and don't require trauma disclosure. These practices align with ethical ABA and improve intervention effectiveness across the board.

### Should I still do an FBA for trauma-affected students?

Yes—but adapt your approach. Use trauma-informed interview questions, avoid triggering exposures during assessment, prioritize safety and relationship-building, and recognize that behavior functions may be linked to trauma triggers (escape from perceived threat, seeking safety/connection).

### What if a student's behavior is maintained by trauma memories, not external consequences?

Collaborate with mental health professionals (school psychologists, trauma therapists). Your role as a BCBA is to teach coping skills, provide environmental supports, and ensure the student feels safe. Trauma processing itself typically falls outside BCBA scope—refer to licensed therapists.
