*Edited by Rob Spain, BCBA, IBA*

Not every behavior problem needs a full Functional Behavior Assessment. But knowing when a student crosses that threshold is one of the hardest calls school teams make.

Conduct an FBA too early, and you waste weeks on a process that could have been solved with a simple intervention. Wait too long, and you miss the window to prevent escalation, due process complaints, or worse, a student getting hurt.

This guide gives you a practical decision matrix to help your team know when a student genuinely needs an FBA and when a lower-tier intervention is the right move.

## Why This Matters: The Cost of Getting It Wrong

An FBA is not a quick checkbox. A well-done FBA requires:

- 10-15 hours of BCBA time (indirect and direct observation, data review, interviews, report writing)
- Teacher time for interviews and data collection
- Coordination across multiple settings and staff
- Often 2-4 weeks from referral to completed report

That is a significant investment. Multiply that across a caseload of 30+ students, and you can see why we need to be strategic about when we launch into a full FBA.

On the flip side, skipping an FBA when it is truly needed leads to:

- Ineffective interventions that do not match the function
- Escalating behaviors that put the student and others at risk
- IEP teams making decisions without data
- Potential due process complaints if parents request one and the district refused

The goal is not to avoid FBAs. The goal is to do them when they will actually help.

## The FBA Decision Matrix

Use this matrix to categorize the student's behavior and determine the appropriate next step.

### Tier 1: Universal Supports (No FBA Needed)

**When to use:** Minor, occasional behaviors that respond to typical classroom management.

**Student profile:**
- Behavior occurs occasionally (less than 1-2 times per week)
- Low intensity (does not disrupt instruction significantly)
- Responds to redirection, prompts, or typical consequences
- No safety concerns
- Behavior is common across many students in the grade level

**Examples:**
- Occasionally talking out of turn during class
- Forgetting to bring materials to class
- Minor off-task behavior during independent work
- Social conflicts during recess that resolve with adult mediation

**Appropriate interventions:**
- Classroom-wide PBIS strategies
- Reteaching expectations
- Visual reminders or prompts
- Proximity and redirection
- Check-in/Check-out (CICO) if slightly elevated

**No FBA required.** These are typical developmental behaviors managed through universal supports.

### Tier 2: Targeted Supports (Simple Hypothesis, No Full FBA)

**When to use:** Moderate, predictable behaviors that occur in specific contexts and have an obvious function.

**Student profile:**
- Behavior occurs regularly (2-5 times per week) but is predictable
- Moderate intensity (disrupts instruction but does not pose safety risk)
- Occurs in specific contexts (certain tasks, times of day, settings)
- Function is relatively clear from observation (e.g., avoids math, seeks peer attention)
- Student has some responsiveness to adults and interventions

**Examples:**
- Calling out during math class to avoid difficult tasks
- Refusing to start written assignments (but complies with verbal tasks)
- Attention-seeking behaviors during transitions
- Mild task refusal when demands are high

**Appropriate interventions:**
- Small group instruction or check-in systems
- Function-based classroom interventions (choice-making, break systems)
- Simple behavior contracts or self-monitoring
- Targeted social skills instruction
- [Tier 2 Behavior Support Plan](/blog/tier-2-behavior-support-plan-template) with clear strategies

**FBA decision:** You can develop a simple hypothesis based on teacher input and brief observations. Document your hypothesis, implement function-based interventions, and monitor progress. If the behavior improves, no formal FBA needed. If it does not respond within 3-4 weeks, move to Tier 3.

### Tier 3: Intensive Supports (Full FBA Required)

**When to use:** Severe, complex, or dangerous behaviors that require individualized assessment and intervention.

**Student profile:**
- Behavior occurs frequently (daily or multiple times per day)
- High intensity (significantly disrupts learning, poses safety risk, or violates others' rights)
- Occurs across multiple settings or staff
- Function is unclear or the behavior serves multiple functions
- Previous interventions have failed
- Behavior may result in suspension, emergency safety interventions, or police involvement

**Examples:**
- Physical aggression toward peers or staff
- Elopement from classroom or campus
- Self-injurious behavior
- Property destruction (throwing furniture, breaking materials)
- Prolonged refusal that halts all instruction
- Behaviors that have led to restraint or seclusion

**Appropriate next step:**
- Conduct a full FBA following IDEA and state requirements
- Include indirect assessments (interviews, record review)
- Conduct direct observations across settings
- Review antecedent-behavior-consequence (ABC) data
- Develop a clear hypothesis about function(s)
- Write a comprehensive BIP tied to the FBA

**FBA is required.** These behaviors meet the legal threshold for assessment under IDEA and require a data-driven, individualized approach.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

### IDEA Requirements

Under IDEA, an FBA is required when:

1. A student's behavior impedes their learning or the learning of others
2. The behavior may result in a change of placement (suspension >10 days)
3. The IEP team determines one is necessary to develop an appropriate BIP

Some states have additional requirements. California, for example, requires an FBA before using emergency interventions or if a student is suspended for more than 10 cumulative days.

### BACB Ethical Guidelines

As behavior analysts, we follow the BACB Ethics Code. Relevant sections include:

- **2.02 Responsibility:** We conduct assessments appropriate to the client's needs and circumstances.
- **3.01 Behavior-Analytic Assessment:** Assessments are based on scientific principles and are appropriate in scope.

Conducting an FBA when not needed wastes resources. Skipping one when it is needed is a failure to provide appropriate services.

### When Parents Request an FBA

If a parent requests an FBA as part of an IEP evaluation, the team must consider it. You can propose alternatives (like Tier 2 supports with progress monitoring), but if the parent insists and the behavior meets Tier 3 criteria, you need to conduct one.

Document the team's decision-making process in the IEP notes regardless of the outcome.

## Decision Tree for Your Team

Here is a simple flowchart your team can use during referral meetings:

**Step 1:** Is the behavior a safety concern (risk of injury to self or others)?
- **Yes** → Full FBA required (Tier 3)
- **No** → Continue to Step 2

**Step 2:** Does the behavior significantly disrupt the student's learning or the learning of others?
- **Yes** → Continue to Step 3
- **No** → Start with Tier 1 universal supports

**Step 3:** Is the function of the behavior clear from observation and teacher report?
- **Yes** → Try Tier 2 interventions with progress monitoring for 3-4 weeks
- **No** → Full FBA required (Tier 3)

**Step 4:** If Tier 2 interventions are in place, is the student making progress?
- **Yes** → Continue Tier 2 supports
- **No after 4 weeks** → Full FBA required (Tier 3)

## What to Do Before Launching an FBA

Even if a student meets Tier 3 criteria, you can save time by gathering preliminary data before the full FBA process:

1. **Collect baseline data.** Have the teacher track frequency, duration, or intensity for 1-2 weeks.
2. **Review records.** Pull attendance data, past IEPs, discipline records, grades, and any previous behavior plans.
3. **Conduct brief interviews.** Talk to the current teacher, previous teachers, and parents to identify patterns.
4. **Clarify the target behavior.** Define exactly what you are assessing (use observable, measurable terms).

This prep work makes the actual FBA faster and more focused.

## Red Flags That Always Warrant an FBA

Some situations demand an FBA regardless of where they fall on the matrix:

- **Behavior results in injury** (to self, peers, or staff)
- **Behavior leads to police involvement or arrest**
- **Student has been restrained or secluded multiple times**
- **Suspension days exceed 10 cumulative in a school year** (manifestation determination threshold)
- **Previous BIP has failed and team does not know why**
- **Behavior function is debated or unclear among team members**

When in doubt, conduct the FBA. It is better to have data you do not end up needing than to lack data when a due process hearing starts.

## Common Mistakes Teams Make

### 1. Jumping Straight to FBA Without Trying Tier 2
If the behavior is moderate, predictable, and the function is clear, try a targeted intervention first. You can always escalate to an FBA if needed.

### 2. Using an FBA Checklist Instead of a Real Assessment
Some districts have "FBA forms" that are just rating scales. That is not an FBA. A real FBA includes interviews, direct observation, ABC data, and a hypothesis statement.

### 3. Delaying an FBA for Dangerous Behaviors
If the behavior is causing harm, do not wait. Start the FBA process immediately.

### 4. Conducting an FBA But Not Using the Data
An FBA is useless if the resulting BIP does not align with the identified function. Make sure your intervention matches your hypothesis.

## How BehaviorSchool Can Help

If your team decides a student needs a full FBA, the [BehaviorSchool FBA-to-BIP tool](/fba-to-bip) streamlines the entire process. Enter your observation data, interviews, and ABC information, and it generates a hypothesis-driven FBA report and function-based BIP in a fraction of the time.

For students at Tier 2, use the [Behavior Plans tool](/behavior-plans) to quickly build simple, targeted interventions without the full FBA process.

Both tools are FERPA-compliant and built specifically for school-based behavior analysts who need legally defensible documentation fast.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do we need an FBA for every student with a BIP?

No. Students at Tier 2 can have a simple behavior support plan based on a clear hypothesis without a formal FBA. However, if the behavior is severe, dangerous, or the function is unclear, a full FBA is required.

### Can we use ABC data instead of a full FBA?

ABC data is part of an FBA, not a replacement for it. A complete FBA includes indirect assessments (interviews, record review), direct observations, ABC data analysis, and a hypothesis statement. If you are only collecting ABC data, you are doing part of an FBA, not the whole thing.

### What if we conduct an FBA and find the function is unclear?

This happens when a behavior serves multiple functions or is maintained by different contingencies across settings. In this case, you may need to conduct further functional analysis (experimental manipulation) or implement a multi-component BIP that addresses multiple possible functions.

### How long should we try Tier 2 interventions before moving to Tier 3?

Give Tier 2 interventions 3-4 weeks of consistent implementation with progress monitoring. If you see no improvement (or the behavior worsens), move to a full FBA. If you see some progress, continue and reassess after another 3-4 weeks.

### Who should conduct the FBA?

Ideally, a BCBA or someone trained in applied behavior analysis. If your district does not have a BCBA, a school psychologist with FBA training can conduct one, but the quality and function-based rigor may vary. Refer to your state's special education guidelines for specific requirements.
