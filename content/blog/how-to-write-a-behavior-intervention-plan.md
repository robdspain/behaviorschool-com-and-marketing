# How to Write a Behavior Intervention Plan: A Step-by-Step Guide for BCBAs

Writing a behavior intervention plan (BIP) is one of the most important things you do as a school-based BCBA. It is also one of the most time-consuming — and one of the most frequently done poorly.

A good BIP is not just a legal requirement. It is a clinical document that tells a staff member exactly what to do when a student's behavior escalates, what to teach as a replacement, and how to know if the plan is working. When written well, it protects the student, the staff, and you.

This guide walks through the full BIP writing process — from using your FBA data to building a plan that implementers can actually follow.

---

## What Is a Behavior Intervention Plan?

A behavior intervention plan is a written document that outlines individualized strategies to address a student's challenging behavior. It must be based on a functional behavior assessment (FBA) and is typically developed as part of a student's IEP process.

Under IDEA 2004, IEP teams are required to consider a behavior intervention plan whenever a student's behavior impedes their learning or the learning of others. For students with disabilities who are subject to disciplinary removals of more than ten days, the law requires both an FBA and a BIP.

A BIP is not a consequence chart. It is not a list of punishments. It is a proactive, function-based document built on understanding why the behavior is happening.

---

## Step 1: Review and Summarize Your FBA

The BIP must be directly linked to your FBA. Before you write a single word of the plan, confirm you can answer these questions from your assessment:

- **What is the target behavior?** Define it in observable, measurable terms.
- **What is the function?** What does the student get or avoid through this behavior?
- **What conditions trigger the behavior?** Time of day, specific tasks, transitions, particular staff or peers?
- **What conditions reduce the behavior?** What's different when the behavior doesn't occur?
- **What's the student's current skill level?** Can they do the replacement behavior, or does it need to be taught?

If you cannot answer these questions confidently, the FBA is not complete enough to write an effective BIP.

---

## Step 2: Define the Target Behavior

Operationalize the behavior in concrete, observable terms that any staff member can use to take data reliably.

**Vague:** "Student is aggressive."

**Better:** "Student hits others with an open or closed hand, with sufficient force to produce sound or contact with skin or clothing, directed at peers or adults."

A good operational definition passes the stranger test — if a substitute teacher read it, they would know exactly what to record and what not to record.

---

## Step 3: Write the Hypothesis Statement

The hypothesis is the core of the BIP. It connects the antecedent, the behavior, and the function in a single clear statement.

Format: *When [antecedent], the student engages in [target behavior] in order to [function].*

Example: *When given a multi-step reading task during independent work time, the student engages in disrupting peers (calling out, touching materials) in order to escape the task demand.*

Everything that follows in the BIP should connect back to this hypothesis. If a strategy you are writing does not address the antecedent, the behavior, or the function, question whether it belongs in the plan.

---

## Step 4: Identify Antecedent Modifications

Antecedent strategies reduce the likelihood the behavior will occur by modifying conditions that set it up. These are proactive — they happen before the behavior.

Based on your hypothesis, consider:

- **Task modifications:** Break multi-step tasks into chunks, provide visual supports, adjust difficulty level
- **Schedule modifications:** Move high-demand tasks earlier in the day, build in movement breaks, provide transition warnings
- **Environmental modifications:** Seat the student away from distractors, provide a quiet work area, reduce noise
- **Instructional modifications:** Provide choice within tasks, use high-preference materials, embed preferred activities
- **Relationship-building strategies:** Daily check-ins with a trusted adult, brief positive attention before demands are placed

List the specific modifications that apply to this student's triggers. Do not copy generic strategies from a template.

---

## Step 5: Define the Replacement Behavior

The replacement behavior serves the same function as the target behavior but is socially acceptable. This is the behavior you are teaching.

Rules for choosing a replacement behavior:
- It must serve the same function (escape, attention, access, sensory)
- It must be easier or at least as efficient as the problem behavior
- The student must be able to learn it

If the function is escape, the replacement might be requesting a break, asking for help, or using a communication card. If the function is attention, the replacement might be raising a hand, greeting an adult appropriately, or using a peer interaction script.

The replacement behavior must be explicitly taught — not just listed in the plan.

---

## Step 6: Outline Teaching Procedures

This is where many BIPs fall short. Stating that a student "will be taught to request a break" is not enough. The plan must describe how the replacement behavior will be taught.

Specify:
- **Who will teach it?** The BCBA? A paraeducator during structured practice?
- **When will teaching happen?** Daily during a specific period? Embedded in natural routines?
- **What teaching method will be used?** Discrete trial, naturalistic teaching, prompting hierarchy, video modeling?
- **What is the reinforcement schedule?** How will the replacement behavior be reinforced initially?

---

## Step 7: Write Reinforcement Strategies

Effective reinforcement is specific, immediate, and matched to the student's preferences. Document:

- **Preferred reinforcers:** Identified through preference assessments or staff/parent input
- **Reinforcement schedule:** Initially more frequent (continuous or dense ratio), faded over time
- **Differential reinforcement:** Reinforce the replacement behavior; withhold reinforcement for the target behavior

Avoid generic statements like "the student will receive praise." Be specific about what type of praise, from whom, delivered how quickly.

---

## Step 8: Develop a Response Plan for the Target Behavior

Even with a well-implemented BIP, the target behavior will still occur — especially early in implementation. The plan must tell staff exactly what to do when it happens.

The response plan should:
- Be calm, consistent, and non-punitive wherever possible
- Describe the immediate response (what staff do in the moment)
- Describe how to prompt the replacement behavior after the episode
- Specify when and how to take data
- Include safety procedures if the behavior is dangerous

Avoid response procedures that inadvertently reinforce the behavior. If the function is escape, removing the task as a consequence reinforces the problem behavior.

---

## Step 9: Define Measurement Procedures

The BIP must include a system for measuring whether the plan is working. Define:

- **What to measure:** Frequency, duration, intensity, or latency of the target behavior
- **When to measure:** During what activities or time periods
- **Who will collect data:** The classroom teacher? A paraeducator? The BCBA?
- **How often will data be reviewed:** Weekly team check-ins, monthly BIP review meetings

Without ongoing data collection, you cannot determine whether the plan is effective or needs to be modified.

---

## Step 10: Plan for Implementation Support

A BIP that is written but not implemented is worthless. Plan for:

- **Staff training:** Who needs to be trained? How will training be delivered?
- **Coaching:** Will you observe implementation and give feedback? How often?
- **BIP review schedule:** When will the team review progress data and consider plan modifications?
- **Fidelity checks:** How will you know staff are implementing the plan correctly?

Implementation support is not optional. IDEA requires that BIPs be implemented with fidelity, and as the BCBA, you are accountable for ensuring that happens.

---

## Common BIP Writing Mistakes

- **No FBA linkage:** Strategies that do not connect to the identified function
- **Vague behavior definitions:** Cannot be reliably measured
- **Missing teaching procedures:** Replacement behaviors listed but not taught
- **Ineffective response plans:** Responses that accidentally reinforce the target behavior
- **No data system:** No way to determine whether the plan is working
- **Not reviewed or updated:** The plan is filed and forgotten

## Writing a BIP Takes Time — But It Does Not Have to Take All of Yours

A thorough BIP takes a significant investment of clinical time — and that time is worth it. But the documentation piece does not have to consume your week.

If you are spending hours reformatting, finding the right legal language, or starting from scratch for every student, the BIP Generator at [plan.behaviorschool.com](https://plan.behaviorschool.com/register) can help. It is built around the structure in this guide — hypothesis, antecedents, replacement behavior, teaching procedures, response plan, and measurement — so your clinical thinking goes into the plan, not into formatting it.
