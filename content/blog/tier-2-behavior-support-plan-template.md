*Edited by Rob Spain, BCBA, IBA*

Tier 1 is not enough, but the student does not need a full FBA yet. Welcome to Tier 2.

Tier 2 interventions sit in the middle: more intensive than universal supports, but less resource-heavy than individualized behavior intervention plans. When implemented well, Tier 2 can prevent 10-15% of students from ever needing Tier 3.

But Tier 2 only works if it is actually targeted, function-informed, and monitored with data. A vague "try a sticker chart" is not Tier 2. A structured check-in/check-out system with daily progress monitoring is.

This guide covers what Tier 2 is, when to use it, evidence-based Tier 2 interventions, and templates you can use tomorrow.

## What Is Tier 2?

Tier 2 represents **targeted supports for students who need more than universal Tier 1 but do not yet require intensive, individualized Tier 3 plans**.

**Key features of Tier 2:**
- For students at risk (about 10-15% of the population)
- Implemented with small groups or individuals
- Low effort to implement (does not require a full FBA)
- Function-informed (based on a simple hypothesis, not a formal assessment)
- Progress monitored with data
- Time-limited (6-12 weeks with decision points)

**Common Tier 2 interventions:**
- Check-in/Check-out (CICO)
- Behavior contracts
- Self-monitoring systems
- Social skills small groups
- Mentoring programs
- Functional communication training (simple)

## When to Use Tier 2

Use Tier 2 when:

- Student is not responding to Tier 1 alone (getting 3-5 redirects per day)
- Behavior is predictable and occurs in specific contexts
- Function is relatively clear from observation (escape, attention, access)
- Behavior is not dangerous or high-intensity
- You want to avoid a full FBA (either because it is not warranted yet or resources are limited)

**Do NOT use Tier 2 if:**
- Behavior is dangerous (aggression, elopement, self-injury)
- Behavior occurs across all settings with no clear pattern
- Function is unclear or the student has multiple competing functions
- Previous Tier 2 interventions have failed

In those cases, skip to Tier 3 and conduct a full FBA.

## Decision-Making: Tier 1 vs Tier 2 vs Tier 3

| Student Profile | Tier |
|----------------|------|
| Responds to Tier 1 supports (occasional redirects, generally compliant) | **Tier 1** |
| Needs 3-5 redirects per day, behavior is predictable, function is clear | **Tier 2** |
| Daily behavior incidents, high intensity, function unclear, or safety concern | **Tier 3 (FBA required)** |

## Evidence-Based Tier 2 Interventions

### 1. Check-In/Check-Out (CICO)

**What it is:** A daily system where a student checks in with an adult in the morning, receives feedback throughout the day on a point sheet, and checks out at the end of the day.

**Best for:** Students seeking adult attention or needing structure and feedback.

**How it works:**

1. **Morning check-in (2-3 minutes):** Student meets with a mentor (teacher, counselor, or administrator) to review goals for the day and receive encouragement.
2. **Daily point sheet:** Student carries a point sheet with 3-5 behavioral goals. Teachers rate the student's behavior each period (e.g., 0-2 points per goal).
3. **Afternoon check-out (2-3 minutes):** Student returns to mentor, reviews points earned, and receives praise or problem-solving support.
4. **Home component (optional):** Point sheet goes home for parent signature and reinforcement.

**Example CICO point sheet:**

| Goal | Period 1 | Period 2 | Period 3 | Period 4 | Period 5 | Period 6 |
|------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Follow directions the first time | 0 1 2 | 0 1 2 | 0 1 2 | 0 1 2 | 0 1 2 | 0 1 2 |
| Keep hands, feet, and objects to self | 0 1 2 | 0 1 2 | 0 1 2 | 0 1 2 | 0 1 2 | 0 1 2 |
| Use respectful language | 0 1 2 | 0 1 2 | 0 1 2 | 0 1 2 | 0 1 2 | 0 1 2 |

**Daily goal:** Earn 80% of possible points

**Reinforcement:**
- Daily: Verbal praise at check-out
- Weekly: If student meets 80% goal 4 out of 5 days, they earn a reward (extra recess, lunch with mentor, small prize)

**Why it works:** Provides structure, increases positive adult attention (often the function), and gives frequent feedback.

**Pitfall to avoid:** Point sheets become punitive. Teachers should focus on what the student did well, not what they did wrong. Frame it as "you earned 10 out of 12 points!" not "you lost 2 points."

### 2. Behavior Contracts

**What it is:** A written agreement between the student, teacher, and sometimes parents that specifies behavioral expectations and rewards for meeting them.

**Best for:** Students who need clear expectations and prefer negotiated agreements (often older elementary, middle, and high school students).

**How it works:**

1. Meet with the student to identify the target behavior (stated positively: "I will raise my hand before speaking" not "I will stop calling out")
2. Set a specific, measurable goal (e.g., "raise hand 8 out of 10 times during class discussions")
3. Identify a reinforcer the student values
4. Write and sign the contract
5. Review progress daily or weekly

**Example behavior contract:**

```
BEHAVIOR CONTRACT

Student: ____________  Teacher: ____________  Date: ____________

TARGET BEHAVIOR (what I will do):
I will raise my hand and wait to be called on before speaking during class discussions.

GOAL:
I will raise my hand at least 8 out of 10 times during whole-group instruction.

REWARD:
If I meet my goal for 4 out of 5 days this week, I earn 15 minutes of free choice time on Friday.

PROGRESS TRACKING:
My teacher will track how many times I raise my hand each day and give me feedback at the end of class.

SIGNATURES:
Student: ____________  Teacher: ____________  Parent: ____________

START DATE: ____________  REVIEW DATE: ____________
```

**Why it works:** Gives the student ownership, makes expectations explicit, and provides clear reinforcement.

**Pitfall to avoid:** Setting goals too high initially. Start with achievable criteria (60-70% success) and increase gradually.

### 3. Self-Monitoring

**What it is:** The student tracks their own behavior using a checklist, timer, or app.

**Best for:** Students who need increased self-awareness and have some level of internal motivation.

**How it works:**

1. Identify the target behavior (on-task, hand-raising, respectful language)
2. Teach the student how to self-monitor (what counts as "on-task"?)
3. Use a timer or cue (e.g., every 10 minutes, a vibrating timer goes off)
4. When cued, student asks: "Was I on-task?" and marks yes/no on a self-monitoring sheet
5. Teacher checks accuracy periodically (does the student's self-assessment match reality?)
6. Reinforce progress

**Example self-monitoring sheet:**

```
SELF-MONITORING: ON-TASK BEHAVIOR

Name: ____________  Date: ____________

Goal: I will be on-task (working on my assignment, eyes on teacher, or raising hand) when the timer beeps.

| Time | Was I on-task? | Teacher Check |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| 9:10 | ☐ Yes  ☐ No | ☐ Yes  ☐ No |
| 9:20 | ☐ Yes  ☐ No | ☐ Yes  ☐ No |
| 9:30 | ☐ Yes  ☐ No | ☐ Yes  ☐ No |
| 9:40 | ☐ Yes  ☐ No | ☐ Yes  ☐ No |
| 9:50 | ☐ Yes  ☐ No | ☐ Yes  ☐ No |

TOTAL: _____ / 5 on-task

GOAL: 4 out of 5 on-task
Did I meet my goal today? ☐ Yes  ☐ No
```

**Why it works:** Increases self-awareness and shifts control to the student.

**Pitfall to avoid:** Student self-monitors inaccurately. Build in teacher checks initially and reinforce honesty ("I love that you were honest about being off-task. That helps us improve!").

### 4. Social Skills Small Groups

**What it is:** Structured, weekly small group instruction on specific social or behavioral skills.

**Best for:** Students struggling with peer interactions, following social norms, or emotional regulation.

**How it works:**

1. Identify 3-6 students with similar skill deficits
2. Meet weekly for 20-30 minutes
3. Teach 1 skill per session (examples: how to join a game, how to handle frustration, how to give a compliment)
4. Use modeling, role-play, and practice
5. Give students opportunities to practice the skill in natural settings (recess, lunch)
6. Provide feedback and reinforcement

**Example lesson: Joining a game**

- **Skill:** How to ask to join a group activity
- **Model:** Adult demonstrates: "Can I play too?" (vs. jumping in uninvited)
- **Practice:** Students role-play asking to join and responding
- **Homework:** Try joining one game at recess this week
- **Follow-up:** Review how it went at next session

**Why it works:** Provides explicit instruction on skills that Tier 1 assumes students already have.

**Pitfall to avoid:** Teaching skills but not practicing in natural settings. Generalization does not happen automatically.

### 5. Functional Communication Training (FCT) - Simple Version

**What it is:** Teaching a student an appropriate way to communicate a need that their problem behavior is currently serving.

**Best for:** Students whose behavior has a clear communication function (escape, attention, access).

**How it works:**

1. Identify the function (example: student calls out to get teacher attention)
2. Teach a replacement communication response (example: raise hand)
3. Reinforce the replacement behavior heavily initially
4. Gradually fade prompts and increase delay to reinforcement

**Example:**

**Problem behavior:** Student yells "I need help!" loudly during independent work (function: teacher attention).

**Replacement:** Teach student to raise a "help card" on their desk and wait quietly.

**Teaching plan:**
- Week 1: Teacher responds immediately when help card is raised (heavy reinforcement)
- Week 2: Teacher responds within 30 seconds
- Week 3: Teacher responds within 1-2 minutes
- Week 4: Student waits until teacher is available, or student tries the problem first

**Why it works:** Addresses the function directly and gives the student a better way to meet their need.

**Pitfall to avoid:** Not reinforcing the replacement behavior consistently. If the replacement does not work reliably, the problem behavior will return.

☐ Fade intervention (reduce support gradually)

If the student is NOT making progress after 6 weeks:
☐ Modify Tier 2 intervention
☐ Escalate to Tier 3 (conduct FBA)

START DATE: ___________
REVIEW DATE: ___________
TEAM MEMBERS: ___________
```

## Example Tier 2 Scenario: 5th Grader with Task Refusal

**Student:** Marcus, 5th grade

**Behavior:** Refuses to start math assignments (pushes paper away, says "I can't do this," puts head down)

**Frequency:** 3-4 times per week during math

**Function hypothesis:** Escape from difficult math tasks

**Tier 2 intervention selected:** Behavior contract + break system

**Plan:**
1. Meet with Marcus to create a contract: "I will attempt the first 3 problems before asking for help or a break"
2. If Marcus completes 3 problems, he can request a 2-minute break or ask for help
3. Reinforcement: If Marcus meets his goal 4 out of 5 days, he earns extra computer time on Friday

**Progress monitoring:** Teacher tracks how many days Marcus meets his goal each week

**Decision rule:**
- After 4 weeks: Marcus is meeting his goal 4-5 days per week. Continue contract and gradually increase expectation to 5 problems before break.
- If after 4 weeks Marcus is still refusing 3+ times per week, escalate to Tier 3 and conduct a formal FBA.

**Outcome:** After 6 weeks, Marcus is consistently attempting assignments. Fade the contract and integrate break system into classroom routine as Tier 1 support.

## When to Move from Tier 2 to Tier 3

Move to Tier 3 if:

- Student is not responding after 6-8 weeks of consistent Tier 2 implementation
- Behavior is escalating (getting more frequent or intense)
- Function is more complex than initially thought
- Behavior poses a safety risk
- Parents or administrators request a formal FBA

Tier 2 is a bridge, not a permanent solution. If the student is not improving, they need Tier 3.

## Common Tier 2 Mistakes

### 1. No Clear Hypothesis About Function

Tier 2 should be function-informed. If you do not have at least a simple hypothesis, you are guessing. A behavior contract will not work if the function is escape (the contract itself becomes another demand).

### 2. Inconsistent Implementation

Tier 2 only works if it is implemented consistently. If the check-in mentor is only available 2 out of 5 days, CICO will not work.

### 3. No Data

You need data to know if Tier 2 is working. "He seems better" is not enough. Track something (point sheet totals, frequency counts, ODRs).

### 4. Using Tier 2 for Dangerous Behaviors

Tier 2 is not appropriate for high-risk behaviors (aggression, elopement, self-injury). Those need immediate Tier 3 intervention with a full FBA.

### 5. Keeping a Student in Tier 2 Too Long

If Tier 2 is not working after 6-8 weeks, move on. Do not let a student languish in Tier 2 for a semester.

## How BehaviorSchool Can Help

The [BehaviorSchool Behavior Plans tool](/behavior-plans) includes ready-to-use Tier 2 templates: CICO point sheets, behavior contracts, self-monitoring forms, and progress monitoring trackers.

For students who need to escalate to Tier 3, the [FBA-to-BIP tool](/fba-to-bip) streamlines the process and ensures your Tier 3 plan is function-based and legally defensible.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long should I try Tier 2 before moving to Tier 3?

6-8 weeks of consistent implementation. If the student shows zero progress after 4 weeks, you can escalate sooner. If they show some progress, give it the full 8 weeks.

### Can a student have an IEP and still be at Tier 2?

Yes. A student can have an IEP for academic reasons and receive Tier 2 behavioral supports. Tier 2 does not require an IEP.

### Can I use CICO with a whole class?

CICO is designed for individual students or small groups. If you want a class-wide system, use Tier 1 strategies (class-wide token economy, group contingency).

### What if the teacher does not have time to implement Tier 2?

Tier 2 is designed to be low-effort. CICO takes 5 minutes per day. A behavior contract takes 10 minutes to set up and 2 minutes daily to monitor. If a teacher truly cannot manage that, the student likely needs Tier 3 with paraprofessional or BCBA support.

### How do I know which Tier 2 intervention to use?

Match the intervention to the function:
- **Attention-seeking:** CICO (provides structured adult attention)
- **Escape:** Behavior contract with break system or FCT (teaches appropriate escape request)
- **Skill deficit:** Social skills group or self-monitoring
- **Access:** FCT (teach appropriate requesting)
