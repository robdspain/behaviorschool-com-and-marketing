*Edited by Rob Spain, BCBA, IBA*

You have an IEP meeting in two days, a caseload of 30 students, and a behavior goal that still says, "Student will improve behavior." That goal will not survive the meeting, and it will not help the student.

This guide gives you 50+ IEP behavior goal examples organized by target behavior. Every example is written in observable, measurable terms and aligns with function-based practice. You can use them as starting points and customize them for your student.

If you need a faster way to individualize goals, use the [BehaviorSchool IEP Goal Writer](/iep-goal-writer). It takes your target behavior and function data and generates a complete goal in minutes.

## Before You Copy a Goal: Use This 6-Part Checklist

Every IEP behavior goal should include:

1. **Condition** (when or where the behavior should occur)
2. **Student** (who is doing the behavior)
3. **Observable behavior** (what the student will do)
4. **Criteria** (how much or how often)
5. **Measurement method** (how you will track it)
6. **Timeframe** (by when, usually one IEP year)

If any of these are missing, the goal will be hard to measure and hard to defend in an IEP meeting.

## The Function-Based Rule

Goals should target **replacement behaviors** that serve the same function as the problem behavior.

- If the function is **escape**, teach requesting breaks or help.
- If the function is **attention**, teach appropriate attention-seeking.
- If the function is **access**, teach requesting or waiting.
- If the function is **sensory**, teach alternative sensory activities.

If you do not have an FBA, consider a brief functional assessment or a review of ABC data. For complex cases, use a full FBA and align the goal with the hypothesis. See [FBA to BIP Workflow](/blog/fba-to-bip-workflow-tier-3) for a step-by-step guide.

## Quick Note on Compliance

Behavior goals are part of the IEP and therefore covered under IDEA. They must be measurable and linked to educational access. Document your data and keep records in FERPA-compliant systems.

## IEP Behavior Goals by Target Behavior

Below are 50+ examples organized by behavior category. Customize the condition, criteria, and measurement method for your student and setting.

### Aggression Goals (Physical or Verbal)

1. **Physical aggression replacement**

## How to Customize These Goals

Use these examples as a starting point, then personalize them:

- **Change the condition** to match the setting (math class, recess, transition)
- **Adjust the criteria** based on baseline data (start at 60-70% success, then increase)
- **Specify the measurement method** (frequency, duration, interval)
- **Align with the function** from the FBA or ABC data

If you need to build goals quickly across a large caseload, use the [BehaviorSchool IEP Goal Writer](/iep-goal-writer). It connects your function data directly to measurable goals.

## Connect Goals to the BIP

Behavior goals should align with the BIP. If your BIP teaches a break request, your goal should measure the break request. If your BIP teaches a coping routine, your goal should measure use of that routine.

For a full example of aligning goals to FBAs and BIPs, see [IEP Behavior Goals: Complete Guide with Examples](/blog/iep-behavior-goals-complete-guide-with-examples) and [Function-Based Behavior Intervention Plans](/blog/function-based-behavior-intervention-plans).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many behavior goals should be in an IEP?

Most IEPs include 1-3 behavior goals focused on the most impactful behaviors. Too many goals can dilute focus and make implementation unrealistic.

### Do I need an FBA before writing behavior goals?

Not always. If the behavior is mild and the function is clear, you can write a goal based on teacher input and brief observation. For severe or complex behaviors, a full FBA is recommended and often required under IDEA.

### What makes a behavior goal legally defensible?

A defensible goal is measurable, observable, linked to educational impact, and aligned with the BIP. It includes clear criteria and a data collection method.

### Should behavior goals be written in positive terms?

Yes. State what the student will do, not what they will stop doing. Focus on replacement behaviors rather than suppression.

### How often should I review progress on behavior goals?

Review data at least monthly. If there is no progress after 4-6 weeks of consistent implementation, revisit the FBA and adjust the plan.
