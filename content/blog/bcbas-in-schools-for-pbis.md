## BCBAs in PBIS: How to support all levels, systemically
An overview of how to integrate the support of board certified behavior analysts into all three levels of PBIS in the school setting.

Current evidence-based practice outlines several key roles and tasks for BCBAs within Tier 1 PBIS in K–12 schools.

These responsibilities focus on preventive, schoolwide strategies and building capacity of educators, rather than individualized therapy.

According to state guidelines and recent surveys, school-based BCBAs frequently engage in the following Tier 1 activities:
Team Leadership & Planning: Serving as key members of the school’s PBIS or MTSS leadership team .

BCBAs help set measurable behavior goals and design school-wide support strategies aligned with ABA principles (e.g. reinforcement systems, clearly defined expectations) .

They attend regular Tier 1 team meetings and contribute behavioral expertise to action planning .

For example, a BCBA may assist the team in co-creating 3–5 positively stated school rules and routines that are taught to all students .
Data Systems & Analysis: Designing and managing behavior data systems to track schoolwide trends .

BCBAs establish efficient data collection for discipline referrals, classroom behavior points, attendance, etc., and help define data-based decision rules .

They regularly analyze Tier 1 data with the team – e.g. looking at office referral patterns by location or time – to identify needs and guide adjustments .

A BCBA will also monitor the fidelity of Tier 1 implementation, such as checking that teachers are using the school’s reward system and following agreed behavior protocols  .
School and Class-Wide Assessment: Conducting needs assessments and observations to evaluate the overall behavior support needs in the school and in individual classrooms .

A BCBA might observe classrooms to assess current classroom management practices and student behavior, providing an objective baseline of Tier 1 practices in use .

They also assist with universal screening processes (e.g. analyzing brief behavior rating scales or referral data) to flag students or settings that may require additional support beyond Tier 1 .

By pinpointing where gaps exist (such as a particular grade level struggling with hallway behavior), BCBAs enable early, targeted interventions before problems escalate .
Enhancing Classroom Management: Supporting teachers in developing and refining classroom management plans that align with school-wide PBIS expectations .

This often includes helping teachers define classroom rules/routines consistent with the school’s values, arrange their classroom environment to prevent problem behaviors, and plan systems to positively reinforce students .

BCBAs can recommend evidence-based strategies (e.g. specific attention signals, behavior-specific praise, group contingencies) and suggest adjustments to management plans as needed .

If a particular class has high misbehavior rates, the BCBA will work with the teacher to strengthen Tier 1 practices or, if necessary, refer the situation for Tier 2 supports .

A recent practitioner survey confirms that rather than pulling individual students, BCBAs devote substantial effort to supporting general education classrooms through such program development and coaching .
Professional Development and Coaching: Facilitating staff training is one of the most frequent BCBA responsibilities in schools  .

BCBAs provide professional development workshops and ongoing coaching to teachers and school staff on PBIS concepts and positive behavior strategies .

Topics include how to effectively teach behavior expectations, how to respond to misbehavior in instructional (non-punitive) ways, and how to implement classroom interventions (like token economies or restorative practices) with fidelity .

Beyond one-time training, BCBAs use modeling and coaching in classrooms: they might demonstrate a behavior strategy or co-teach a lesson on social skills, then observe and give feedback as teachers practice these skills .

This “I do, we do, you do” gradual release approach helps build teacher capacity to manage behavior independently .

By coaching educators, BCBAs extend their impact to all students in the building, not just those on their caseload .
Reinforcement and Acknowledgement Systems: Assisting in the design of school-wide acknowledgment systems for positive behavior.

At Tier 1, BCBAs help create programs to regularly recognize and reward students for meeting expectations (such as point systems, assemblies, praise notes) .

They ensure these reinforcement systems follow behavioral principles (consistent, immediate, age-appropriate rewards) and analyze data to keep them effective.

For instance, a BCBA might set up a token economy school store and use data to determine if recognition is happening at a high rate across all classrooms  .

They also coach staff to use praise and rewards consistently, since acknowledging positive behavior is a core Tier 1 practice  .
Maintaining PBIS Fidelity and Equity: BCBAs often take on the role of Tier 1 fidelity checker – using PBIS fidelity tools or checklists to assess how well the school is implementing core features (e.g. are 80% of students able to state the expectations? Are teachers using the referral process correctly?)  .

They share these evaluation results with the team to celebrate successes or address gaps.

Additionally, behavior analysts contribute to equitable PBIS practices by examining data disaggregated by race/ethnicity or other factors to ensure the Tier 1 supports are benefitting all groups fairly  .

Recent literature notes BCBAs have been tasked with initiatives like assessing discipline equity in schools (examining if any student subgroup is disproportionately receiving referrals or suspensions) as part of their expanded role .

This data-driven approach aligns with PBIS’s commitment to serving all students and creating a positive, inclusive climate.
Each of the above tasks is grounded in evidence-based practice.

For example, coaching teachers in behavior management has been shown to improve classwide behavior and is a common responsibility of BCBAs .

Developing school-wide positive supports and reinforcement systems is explicitly cited as a duty that BCBAs take on in many schools .

By focusing on Tier 1, BCBAs aim to prevent problems proactively and create supportive environments, which reduces the need for intensive interventions later .

Importantly, BCBAs always coordinate these efforts with school administrators and multi-disciplinary teams – collaboration is key to integrating ABA strategies into the broader school context .
## Real-World Implementation Models and Examples
U.S. school districts are increasingly leveraging BCBAs in innovative ways to strengthen Tier 1 PBIS implementation.

Rather than working in isolation or only with special education, BCBAs are embedded in school teams to influence schoolwide practices.

Below are a few models (backed by real examples and guidance) illustrating how BCBAs contribute at Tier 1:
Integrated MTSS/PBIS Teams: One model is to include the BCBA as a standing member of each school’s PBIS or MTSS leadership team.

For instance, a public school district in Massachusetts reorganized its student support services so that all mental and behavioral health staff (school psychologists, counselors, social workers, and BCBAs) work in building-based teams rather than silos .

They revised job descriptions to explicitly include MTSS/PBIS responsibilities, ensuring BCBAs collaborate with educators and administrators on Tier 1 planning .

In this model, the BCBA might co-facilitate the monthly Tier 1 meetings, help lead data discussions, and guide the team in selecting evidence-based Tier 1 strategies.

The emphasis is on collective responsibility: the BCBA is a consultant and coach to the whole school, not just a separate specialist.

Early reports from such integrations suggest positive outcomes like more consistent behavior practices and less reliance on reactive discipline  .
District-Level PBIS Coaches (Multi-School Support): Some districts employ BCBAs in district-level roles to support Tier 1 across multiple schools.

These individuals often carry titles like PBIS Coordinator, Behavior Analyst Coach, or Climate and Culture Coach.

For example, in one California district, a “Climate and Culture Coach” position was created to ensure strong Tier 1 PBIS and restorative practices in every middle school .

This district-level BCBA (or similarly trained specialist) travels between schools to assist each site’s PBIS team, provide teacher trainings, and roll out proactive programs.

They ensure that each school has the core Tier 1 elements in place (clear expectations, teaching of social-emotional skills, reward systems, etc.) and also help implement Tier 2 supports like Check-In/Check-Out as needed .

Such a model brings consistency and expertise, as the BCBA can share data and successful strategies across campuses.

Research notes that BCBAs working across sites serve as a valuable resource for building system capacity, bringing specialized ABA knowledge to multiple schools where full-time behavior experts may not be present .
Capacity-Building via Coaching: A common real-world approach is using BCBAs primarily as instructional coaches for behavior.

In this role, the BCBA spends a large portion of time in classrooms mentoring teachers.

For example, after a baseline classroom observation, the BCBA might meet with a teacher to praise effective practices and suggest one or two Tier 1 strategies to implement (like increasing the rate of praise or tweaking a classroom routine) .

They then follow up regularly to coach the teacher in using those strategies, gradually releasing responsibility.

This coaching model has proven effective in shifting schools from reactive discipline to preventive support: “behavior staff can move out of a reactive disciplinary role and focus on what makes a lasting difference – an MTSS/PBIS system that fits the context, with proactive interventions and building teacher capacity”  .

In practice, schools that utilize BCBAs as coaches report improved classroom climates and fewer crisis situations, because teachers feel more equipped to manage behavior positively.

The evidence-backed principle here is that when teachers implement Tier 1 practices with fidelity (with coaching support), overall student behavior improves and the need for Tier 3 crisis interventions drops  .
Guidance and Support Frameworks: At the state level, there are emerging frameworks to maximize BCBAs’ impact on Tier 1.

For instance, Connecticut’s education department published guidelines for BCBAs in schools highlighting their role in systems-level work like PBIS .

These guidelines explicitly enumerate Tier 1 functions for BCBAs (e.g. conducting schoolwide assessments, training staff, monitoring data) and emphasize that BCBAs should focus on capacity-building and prevention in addition to student-specific services  .

The document encourages districts to use BCBAs as behavior specialists who ensure the school’s universal supports are evidence-based and implemented correctly.

This kind of formal role description helps school administrators structure BCBA positions to align with PBIS.

Similarly, researchers have called for supporting school-based BCBAs through professional networks and models that enhance their ability to lead Tier 1 and other MTSS initiatives  .

The trend is toward clearly defined roles where the BCBA is a linchpin in the school’s positive behavior support system.
All these models share a focus on sustainable, schoolwide impact.

Crucially, BCBAs working in K–12 settings are expected to collaborate with other professionals (administrators, teachers, counselors) in a transdisciplinary way.

This collaboration ensures that Tier 1 strategies are feasible and culturally relevant, not just technically sound .

By embedding BCBAs in school teams and coaching cycles, schools can use data-driven behavior strategies more effectively, benefiting all students.

In sum, the current best practice is to utilize BCBAs as PBIS facilitators, coaches, and data-guided problem solvers at the Tier 1 level – a role well-supported by both the science of ABA and the PBIS framework .



## BCBAs and Tier 2 PBIS Supports in Public Schools
Tiered Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) is fundamentally rooted in applied behavior analysis.

In fact, Horner and Sugai – architects of school-wide PBIS – describe it as “applied behavior analysis implemented at a scale of social importance” .

Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs), with their expertise in ABA, are therefore well-positioned to enhance PBIS at all levels.

This deep dive focuses on Tier 2 supports – targeted interventions for at-risk students – and how BCBAs can contribute within public school districts to strengthen these systems.
## Understanding Tier 2 Interventions in PBIS
Tier 2 supports are the targeted, group-based interventions provided to the 10-15% of students who do not fully succeed with Tier 1 universal supports alone .

The goal at Tier 2 is to intervene early before problem behaviors escalate, by teaching and reinforcing appropriate behaviors in a more focused way .

Tier 2 interventions are often delivered in small groups (or sometimes individually) and include strategies such as:
Check-In/Check-Out (CICO) – a structured daily mentoring and feedback system (also called the Behavior Education Program)
Social skills groups or counseling groups – teaching social-emotional or self-regulation skills in a small group setting
Self-management and Daily Report Cards – students track their own behavior goals or use point sheets that teachers sign, with rewards for meeting goals
Group contingencies or mentoring programs – e.g. reinforcement systems like the Good Behavior Game (a class-wide group contingency) or pairing students with adult mentors
These Tier 2 practices are grounded in ABA principles.

For example, self-management checklists, token economies, and point card systems all rely on prompting, positive reinforcement, modeling, and progress monitoring to change behavior .

A Tier 2 plan typically increases adult feedback and structure for participating students, and provides additional practice of skills beyond what Tier 1 offers .

Importantly, students receiving Tier 2 still benefit from all Tier 1 supports; Tier 2 augments those foundational school-wide expectations and rewards .
Check-In/Check-Out (CICO) is one of the most widely used Tier 2 interventions nationwide .

In CICO, students begin each day by checking in with a coordinator to review behavior goals and pick up a Daily Report Card, receive regular feedback and points from teachers in class, then check out in the afternoon to review progress and rewards with the coordinator .

This simple program has several benefits: it increases predictable prompts and feedback for positive behavior, creates a structured daily routine, and improves communication with families through the daily point card that goes home .

Extensive research has shown CICO to be an evidence-based Tier 2 practice.

Multiple studies and meta-analyses find that CICO can significantly increase academic engagement and prosocial behavior while reducing disruptive behavior for at-risk students – especially when the root of the behavior problem is attention-seeking .

In group-design studies, CICO yields moderate improvements on average (overall effect size ~0.42), with particularly strong effects in elementary grades .

Teachers and parents also rate CICO as a socially acceptable and positive support in most cases .
Aside from CICO, schools may implement Tier 2 supports like small-group behavior coaching, anger management classes, or check & connect mentoring.

Group reinforcement contingencies (like the Good Behavior Game) can serve as Tier 2 or class-wide supports that have shown powerful outcomes (e.g. long-term reductions in aggressive behavior and even later-life benefits in studies of the Good Behavior Game ).

What all these interventions share is a basis in applied behavior analysis – using structured behavioral strategies to teach, reinforce, and shape student behavior.

In fact, if a school is implementing PBIS with fidelity, they are already using ABA methods within a multi-tiered framework .

However, to get the full benefits of Tier 2, these interventions must be selected thoughtfully and implemented correctly.

This is where BCBAs can play a critical role.

## The BCBA’s Role in Strengthening Tier 2 Supports
BCBAs are highly trained in behavioral assessment, intervention design, and data-driven decision making .

In public school districts, the roles of BCBAs vary, but they frequently serve as behavior specialists, coaches, and consultants rather than classroom teachers .

Research surveying school-based BCBAs found that their responsibilities often include facilitating professional development, coaching educators, and developing behavior programs for general and special education students, with less emphasis on 1:1 student therapy .

In other words, school BCBAs are commonly tasked with building capacity – teaching the teachers – which aligns perfectly with improving Tier 2 systems.
## Here are several key ways BCBAs can support and enhance Tier 2 PBIS interventions in a district:
1.

Data-Based Identification and Intervention Matching:  BCBAs bring expertise in assessment – they can help schools use discipline data, teacher referrals, universal screening results, and functional behavior assessments to identify which students need Tier 2 and what support fits best .

Rather than a haphazard or one-size-fits-all approach, a BCBA can guide a systematic process for linking student needs (e.g. attention-maintained behavior, escape-motivated behavior, skill deficits) to an appropriate Tier 2 intervention.

In fact, researchers have developed structured tools like the Student Intervention Matching (SIM) Form specifically to improve Tier 2 outcomes by better matching interventions to the function of student behavior .

Using such defensible assessments, a BCBA ensures that a student is placed in, say, a social skills group or CICO program that directly targets the reasons behind their behavior challenges.
2.

Designing and Refining Tier 2 Programs: Once needs are identified, BCBAs can design or refine the intervention plan.

Many Tier 2 supports exist as “packaged” programs (CICO, SEL curricula, etc.), but they often need adaptation to the local context.

BCBAs are skilled in the nuts and bolts of behavior change – they can set clear, measurable behavior goals, create easy-to-use Daily Report Cards or point charts, define reinforcers and criteria for success, and develop any lesson materials for group sessions.

For example, in one district a BCBA collaborated with a school counselor to adjust a self-regulation group intervention (Zones of Regulation curriculum) for a particular student whose existing behavior plan wasn’t working.

The BCBA applied ABA strategies to individualize the group curriculum to the student’s needs, resulting in a renewed positive response to the intervention.

BCBAs ensure that Tier 2 interventions aren’t just token “star charts,” but truly functional behavior-change plans with meaningful targets and progress monitoring.
3.

Training and Coaching School Staff (Building Capacity): Perhaps the most critical contribution of a BCBA is serving as a coach for the adults implementing Tier 2.

Tier 2 supports are typically delivered by regular school personnel – teachers, counselors, deans, etc., not by the BCBA alone .

Thus, the BCBA amplifies impact by training and guiding staff in how to implement interventions correctly.

A school’s Tier 2 team often includes a behavior specialist or BCBA whose job is to provide professional development, modeling, and feedback .

For example, a BCBA might conduct a workshop on the principles of reinforcement and how to use a Daily Report Card, or how to run a social skills lesson using behavior modeling techniques.

After training, the BCBA can then observe classrooms and group sessions, offering real-time coaching to ensure strategies like praise, prompts, and data collection are being done with fidelity.

This aligns with the behavior-analytic practice of Behavioral Skills Training (BST) – training adults through instruction, modeling, practice, and feedback.

By coaching staff, BCBAs multiply the reach of Tier 2 supports across many students.
Example: A middle school BCBA noticed several students with frequent off-task and disruptive behaviors who hadn’t qualified for special education.

The BCBA reviewed referral and grade data to flag a group of at-risk students for extra support.

She then created a streamlined Check-In/Check-Out system for them – designing a simple point card aligned with the school’s expectations and setting up a 5-minute morning check-in and afternoon check-out routine.

The BCBA provided training for teachers and aides on how to greet students, state the daily goals, give feedback each class period, and award points for positive behaviors (using modeling and practice scenarios to build teacher comfort).

Additionally, the BCBA met with the students weekly to teach replacement behaviors (like raising hand instead of blurting, using self-regulation techniques during frustration) in a small group setting.

Over the next month, she monitored the daily point data and coached staff on increasing praise and tweaking goals.

As a result, teachers went from just hastily filling out point cards to actively engaging with students about behavior goals – and student on-task rates improved.

This vignette illustrates how a BCBA can boost the fidelity and effectiveness of Tier 2 interventions by training and mentoring the implementers.
4.

Ensuring Fidelity and Using Data for Decision-Making: BCBAs also focus on the integrity of interventions.

Research shows that many Tier 2 efforts (including CICO) suffer when key components are inconsistently implemented – for example, teachers forgetting to give feedback, or families not signing point cards .

Such lapses can weaken the impact of the intervention .

A BCBA on the team helps prevent this by regularly checking the fidelity of implementation.

They might develop a simple fidelity checklist for CICO (Did the student check in? Were goals reviewed? Did each teacher give points and feedback each period? Was the parent notified at day’s end? etc.) and then sample some data to see if all steps are happening .

If not, the BCBA can problem-solve with the team – maybe staff need a reminder or additional support, or parents need a different way to engage.

One study noted that when schools strengthened the home-school communication in CICO (ensuring parents reviewed the daily report), students showed stronger behavior gains, underlining the importance of full fidelity .

BCBAs bring a rigorous eye for data: they collect and graph student progress, analyze trends, and help the Tier 2 team decide when to tweak an intervention, fade supports, or move a student to Tier 3 if needed .

This data-driven coaching role is explicitly recommended in PBIS models – Tier 2 team members should “understand and review data” and “prompt, model, and provide feedback” to staff for good implementation .

In short, the BCBA helps the school measure what matters (behavior outcomes and fidelity) and use those measurements to continuously improve Tier 2 supports.
5.

Modeling Interventions and Using Support Personnel: In some districts, BCBAs supervise Registered Behavior Technicians (RBTs) or behavior aides who can assist with Tier 2 implementation.

While teachers and counselors are primary Tier 2 facilitators, an RBT (under BCBA supervision) can be deployed as an expert model in the classroom.

For instance, an RBT might spend a few days in a teacher’s class running a self-monitoring procedure with a student, effectively demonstrating the intervention and how to reinforce the student, while the teacher observes and learns.

The RBT then gradually hands off responsibility back to the teacher.

This “I do, we do, you do” gradual release is a powerful way to build teacher confidence .

By designing a system where RBTs serve as coaches-in-action (not just 1:1 aides), BCBAs can scale up Tier 2 supports without overburdening any single teacher.

Registered Behavior Technicians act as the bridge between BCBA-designed systems and daily classroom practice, ensuring interventions are carried out with fidelity while also building capacity in school staff.

This approach has been used in some California districts – for example, San Francisco USD has utilized BCBA/RBT behavior teams that intensively support a classroom for a few weeks, then fade out as the school staff take over, thus spreading practical skills.
6.

Integrating Tier 2 Across General and Special Education: A challenge in many districts is siloing of supports.

Often, BCBAs are hired under special education departments and focus primarily on students with IEPs (Tier 3 cases), which can lead to neglect of Tier 2 for general education students.

In a recent California survey, about half of school BCBAs reported supporting general education students , meaning the other half worked only in special ed contexts.

Many times, students with IEPs or significant behavioral needs are escalated directly to intensive Tier 3 supports (e.g. a full behavior intervention plan) and skip Tier 2 interventions, potentially due to the assumption that Tier 2 is only for gen-ed.

BCBAs can advocate for a more inclusive approach: any student with recurring behavior issues should have access to targeted (Tier 2) strategies, whether or not they receive special education.

In practice, that might mean a BCBA helps a general-ed student on a 504 plan by designing a behavior contract or self-monitoring plan (Tier 2), rather than waiting until the student “fails” and then doing a full FBA/BIP.

Conversely, for a student with an IEP who has behavior goals, the BCBA can make sure Tier 2 programs (like a social skills lunch bunch or CICO) are layered on top of their IEP services.

This crossover ensures consistency and equity – that Tier 2 supports are available based on need, not label.

It also maximizes efficiency: the intensive Tier 3 resources are reserved for the most extreme cases, while moderate needs get a moderate intervention.

Districts can facilitate this by giving BCBAs the flexibility (and administrative support) to participate in school-wide PBIS teams and not just IEP meetings .

When included in school leadership discussions on behavior support, BCBAs can help embed ABA-based strategies across all tiers.

## Evidence of Impact: Why BCBA Involvement Matters
Having BCBA expertise integrated into Tier 2 systems can significantly improve outcomes and sustainability of PBIS.

A 2024 survey study noted that “the inclusion of a BCBA on school-based teams can mitigate many issues educators face involving feasibility, effectiveness, and fidelity of behavioral support implementation” .

In other words, when a BCBA is actively involved, interventions are more likely to be workable in a school setting, done correctly, and actually effective.

Other researchers have documented that school-based BCBAs have been instrumental in developing school-wide PBIS frameworks, training staff in de-escalation, and promoting equitable discipline practices .

By applying the scientific, systematic lens of ABA to the everyday context of classrooms, BCBAs help ensure that behavior supports are not only well-designed but also sustained over time.
One clear example is in treatment fidelity.

A qualitative study of BCBAs working in schools found that many struggled with lack of time and administrative support, which led to inadequate teacher training and poor ABA implementation fidelity in classrooms .

When teachers are under-trained or misconceptions about behavior strategies persist, even evidence-based programs can falter.

The study concluded that increasing support for BCBAs – e.g. reasonable caseloads and backing from school leaders – is crucial because low fidelity in behavioral interventions results in decreased positive outcomes for students .

This underscores that it’s not enough to adopt a Tier 2 program; the program must be implemented the right way.

BCBAs serve as guardians of fidelity, and when empowered to do so, they improve the consistency and quality of interventions delivered by school staff.
Furthermore, BCBAs often collect meaningful data that can persuade stakeholders of success.

For instance, a BCBA-led Tier 2 support might show a clear reduction in office referrals or an uptick in class participation among the target group, providing the data-based evidence that encourages principals and teachers to continue investing in PBIS.

Over time, this builds a positive culture where behavioral support is seen as part of education rather than an added burden.

Schools that effectively use their “behavior experts” report better overall climate and student outcomes.

In one anecdotal example, a Southern California district created a “Climate and Culture Coach” position (held by a behavior specialist) for each middle school – this coach oversees PBIS Tier 1 and 2 implementation, including running CICO and social skill groups and coordinating restorative practices .

As a result, the schools had more consistent Tier 2 offerings and were able to intervene with at-risk students earlier.

This kind of systemic integration of behavior expertise reflects what research suggests: when behavior staff (BCBAs, behavior specialists, etc.) are embedded in the MTSS/PBIS teams, they become leaders in coaching other staff, monitoring fidelity, and scaling up interventions .

They shift the school from a reactive, punitive discipline model to a proactive instructional approach to behavior .

## Challenges and Considerations
While the benefits of BCBA involvement at Tier 2 are evident, there are practical challenges to address:
Capacity and Caseload: Many BCBAs in districts juggle large caseloads (e.g. assessing dozens of individual Tier 3 cases) which leaves limited time for Tier 2 efforts.

In a California survey, school BCBAs reported an average caseload of ~15 students (some had 30-50), and “lack of time” was the most common challenge identified (BAESIG, 2023).

Districts should be mindful to allocate sufficient BCBA staffing if they expect robust Tier 2 coaching support.

Using RBTs or behavior technicians can extend a BCBA’s reach, but those RBTs also require supervision time.

A New Jersey guidance on school BAs suggests considering the intensity of support (Tier 1 vs Tier 2 vs Tier 3) when determining a reasonable workload   – a reminder that supporting 20 students with intensive needs is far more labor-intensive than supporting 20 on a simple CICO plan.
Role Clarity and Administrative Buy-In: There is sometimes lack of understanding among decision-makers about what BCBAs do beyond autism support.

Since BCBAs are not yet licensed or credentialed by state education agencies (in many states), their role in general education can be ambiguous.

Administrators may default to using them only for special ed compliance (FBAs, IEPs) or crisis cases.

Educating school leaders about the BCBA’s potential role in school-wide systems is key.

One strategy is to invite BCBAs to leadership meetings or PBIS Tier 2 team meetings so they have a voice in preventative planning, not just reactive case review  .

When principals see BCBAs contribute to things like designing a school-wide reward system or analyzing office referral trends, they begin to view them as essential partners in school improvement, not just “behavior fixers” for individual students.
Integration with Other Staff: Schools already have counselors, school psychologists, social workers, and deans who handle behavior interventions.

It’s important to position the BCBA as a collaborator, not a competitor.

Successful districts form multi-disciplinary teams (e.g. a Tier 2 team might include a counselor, a psych, a BCBA, an administrator, and a teacher) to collectively design supports  .

Each brings unique skills: the counselor may run a talk-based group, the BCBA might contribute a data-tracking component to that group, for example.

Clear communication and mutual respect are vital.

Notably, the Behavior Analyst Certification Board’s ethics code now requires BCBAs to engage in collaborative practice with other professionals   – highlighting how integral teamwork is in schools.

When BCBAs work with existing staff (training paras, teaming up with a teacher in a classroom, etc.), the entire school benefits from a more coordinated approach.
Sustainability and Scale: Implementing Tier 2 supports is not a one-time event but an ongoing process.

BCBAs should help set up systems that can continue even if staff turnover occurs or if the BCBA is unavailable.

This could include developing manuals, forms, and training materials for Tier 2 interventions, so that knowledge is institutionalized.

Also, focusing on building the skills of school staff (teachers learning behavior strategies, principals learning to use data) creates a sustainable model.

The end goal is a school culture where teachers can handle common behavior issues using Tier 1 and 2 strategies confidently, calling on BCBAs for support with more complex cases or coaching refreshers.

As one PBIS coach put it, the BCBA and behavior team should aim to “shift from being emergency responders to being inclusive community-builders”, empowering teachers to manage classrooms and only stepping in for the toughest situations  .

## Maximizing BCBA Impact at Tier 2: Recommendations
## To fully leverage BCBAs in supporting Tier 2 PBIS in public schools, consider these action steps:
Include BCBAs in PBIS Planning: Ensure your district’s PBIS/MTSS leadership teams include your behavior analysts.

Their input on which Tier 2 interventions to adopt and how to implement them can save a lot of trial-and-error.

As an example, BCBAs can contribute to developing a Tier 2 menu of interventions that matches student needs (e.g. a mentoring program for students lacking adult connections, a group contingency for classes with high disruptions, CICO for attention-maintained cases, etc.).
Provide Time for Coaching: Adjust BCBA schedules so they have dedicated hours for Tier 2 work (not just endless Tier 3 crises).

This might involve hiring additional BCBAs or behavior specialists to distribute the caseload.

When BCBAs have time to observe classrooms, meet with teachers, and attend Tier 2 team meetings, the quality of Tier 2 implementation rises markedly  .

Some districts are creating BCBA Coordinator roles (or MTSS behavior coordinators) to explicitly oversee tiered behavior supports and coach school teams.
Professional Development Partnerships: Utilize BCBAs as trainers alongside other experts.

For instance, if a district is rolling out a new social-emotional curriculum or a restorative practices initiative, a BCBA can co-train with the school counselor, adding the behavioral strategies that increase the fidelity of these programs.

BCBAs can also train support staff (teaching assistants, noon supervisors, etc.) in behavior techniques, multiplying the positive adult interactions students experience.
Blend ABA with Other Approaches: PBIS Tier 2 might include interventions from various frameworks (SEL, trauma-informed practices, etc.).

BCBAs should be open to integrating these with ABA strategies.

For example, a BCBA can incorporate restorative dialogue as part of a behavior plan, combined with reinforcement for positive behavior changes.

As noted in one practice guide, behavior staff (BCBAs) who embrace approaches like restorative practices – focusing on relationship-building and student values – can help shift school climate away from punishment and toward skill-building  .

This holistic mindset increases teacher buy-in, as teachers see the BCBA’s work aligning with their own values and professional development (not just pure behaviorism in isolation).
Highlight Successes: Gather and share data on the impact of BCBA-driven Tier 2 supports.

Did office referrals drop for participants? Did teacher reports of class disruption decrease? Are more students being supported instead of suspended? Celebrating these wins with both school staff and the school board will solidify support for maintaining and expanding BCBA positions.

It transforms the BCBA from a “nice to have” into an indispensable asset for achieving the school’s academic and behavior goals.
In conclusion, BCBAs can be powerful catalysts for effective Tier 2 PBIS implementation in public schools.

They bring a deep understanding of behavior science that complements the educational expertise of teachers and administrators.

By collaborating through data-driven coaching, intervention design, and fidelity monitoring, BCBAs help create Tier 2 supports that are practical, consistent, and impactful.

As one article put it, behavior analysts in schools are now taking on “a variety of roles…providing coaching to educators, developing programs for general education, and even building school-wide positive behavior supports” .

Their involvement “produces sustained behavior change across each tiered level of support” .

For students, this means more needs met early, fewer behavior problems left to fester, and a greater chance to thrive in a positive school environment.

For staff, it means having a coach in their corner to build confidence and competence in managing behavior.

And for the system as a whole, it means PBIS isn’t just a box of interventions, but a living, learning framework – one that uses behavioral expertise to support all students, not just at Tier 3, but at every step of the way.


## Tier 3 PBIS Individualized Supports for BCBAs in K–12 Schools
## Overview of Tier 3 PBIS Supports
Tier 3 of Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) provides intensive, individualized support for the small subset of students (roughly 1–5%) whose needs are not met by Tier 1 or 2 interventions .

These students often exhibit dangerous or highly disruptive behaviors that impede learning and inclusion, or have serious emotional/mental health challenges.

Tier 3 supports build upon Tier 1 and 2 foundations and involve a multidisciplinary team (including a BCBA for behavior expertise) working with the student and family .

A hallmark of Tier 3 is the use of functional behavior assessment (FBA) to understand why the student behaves as they do, followed by a function-based behavior intervention plan (BIP) tailored to that student .

Effective Tier 3 plans include strategies for preventing problem behaviors, teaching appropriate replacement behaviors, reinforcing positive behavior, removing rewards for misbehavior, and ensuring safety .

Wraparound services (e.g. integrating family and community supports) and person-centered planning are often used to address broad needs (social, emotional, academic) in a holistic, culturally responsive way .

In short, Tier 3 PBIS is a data-driven, team-based process to deliver comprehensive, individualized behavior support so students with the most intensive needs can succeed in school (Center on PBIS, n.d.) .
Role of BCBAs: Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs) in school districts are typically key players on Tier 3 teams, providing expertise in behavior assessment and intervention design .

They lead FBAs, develop and oversee BIPs, train staff, and use progress data to guide decision-making .

Below, we focus on three current evidence-based practices BCBAs are using for individualized Tier 3 supports: Practical Functional Assessment (PFA), Skill-Based Treatment (SBT), and Acceptance and Commitment Training (ACT).
## Practical Functional Assessment (PFA) for Tier 3 Behavior Support
Practical Functional Assessment (PFA) is an enhanced approach to functional behavior assessment that has gained strong empirical support in recent years (Hanley et al., 2014; Santiago et al., 2016).

Developed by Dr.

Gregory Hanley and colleagues, PFA is an interview-informed, streamlined functional analysis process designed to identify the causes of severe challenging behavior in a safe, efficient, and client-centered manner .

The PFA process begins with extensive open-ended interviews with teachers, parents, and the student (when possible) to gather rich information about events that reliably trigger or reinforce the problem behavior .

From these insights, the BCBA designs a brief experimental analysis – often called an Interview-Informed Synthesized Contingency Analysis (IISCA) – in which multiple suspect triggers and reinforcers are combined and tested together (as opposed to one at a time in a traditional FBA).

This synthesized analysis reflects the reality that challenging behaviors usually serve more than one function (e.g. escape and attention), and it aims to reproduce the motivating conditions in a controlled way to confirm the behavior’s function without provoking dangerous crises .

Unlike lengthy traditional functional analyses that often require multiple sessions and intentionally provoke high rates of problem behavior, a PFA/IISCA is typically conducted in an assent-based manner (the student can opt out at any time), seeks to elicit only low-level precursors of the problem behavior (keeping everyone safer), and often yields clear results in a single session .

This practical approach has been shown to produce reliable and meaningful outcomes, even for very severe behaviors, with far less risk and time than older methods .
Evidence Base: PFA is backed by a growing body of research.

The initial demonstration by Hanley et al. (2014) showed it could produce large reductions in problem behaviors by tailoring treatments to synthesized reinforcement contingencies.

Since then, at least 16 replication studies and two review papers have been published, consistently supporting the reliability and effectiveness of the PFA process across diverse populations and settings .

For example, Santiago et al. (2016) conducted systematic replications in school and home settings, demonstrating that interview-informed functional analyses can be feasibly and effectively implemented in public school classrooms (not just clinical labs) .

Many subsequent studies have replicated the PFA/IISCA approach (over 30 by 2016, per Jessel et al., 2016) and found that it leads to successful intervention outcomes (Jessel et al., 2018; Fiani et al., 2022).

Recent research also supports the generality of PFA: Coffey et al. (2021) found that the PFA and its treatment outcomes generalized across individuals with autism as well as those with other developmental or mental health disorders .

In sum, PFA has emerged as a best-practice FBA strategy for Tier 3 because it identifies functions of behavior quickly, humanely (with a trauma-informed, person-centered ethos), and with strong likelihood of yielding an effective intervention (Rajaraman et al., 2022) .
BCBA Action – How to Implement PFA: In practice, a BCBA in a school would implement a PFA by first conducting interviews with those who know the student best to identify probable triggers (e.g. academic demands, peer conflict) and what the student achieves through the behavior (e.g. escape, attention, sensory stimulation).

The BCBA then structures a brief analysis in a safe environment (such as an empty classroom or after school setting), where they deliberately present the suspected triggers and immediately provide the suspected reinforcers contingent on the first sign of the problem behavior.

For example, if interviews suggest a student’s outbursts are maintained by escaping difficult tasks and gaining adult attention, the BCBA might simulate a scenario of a difficult task demand; as soon as the student begins to get agitated (a precursor to a full outburst), the BCBA would remove the task and comfort the student (synthesized reinforcement).

Through this process, the team confirms the function(s) maintaining the behavior without allowing a full dangerous episode.

This functional insight then directly informs the design of the intervention plan. (See “Skill-Based Treatment” below for how the PFA results translate into a plan.)
## Skill-Based Treatment (SBT) for Individualized Intervention
Once the function of the behavior is understood via PFA, the next step is implementing Skill-Based Treatment (SBT) – an individualized intervention plan grounded in teaching the student alternative skills to get their needs met safely and appropriately.

SBT was introduced by Hanley and colleagues as the treatment package following a PFA/IISCA and is sometimes referred to as “today’s ABA” for addressing severe behaviors (Hanley, 2015, as cited in McGreevy, 2024) .

It is a multicomponent, function-based intervention that focuses on replacing the problem behavior with a set of positive, socially acceptable skills, rather than relying on punishment or mere suppression .

Crucially, SBT is implemented in a trauma-informed and person-centered manner: the intervention context is designed to make the student feel safe, in control, and engaged, avoiding coercion or undue stress .

This reflects a paradigm shift – moving away from solely eliminating “bad” behavior toward teaching and reinforcing meaningful new skills (communication, coping, etc.) that address the root causes of the behavior .
Core Elements of SBT: A hallmark of skill-based treatment is teaching an individual three key skill domains in a systematic sequence :
Functional Communication Response (FCR): First, the student is taught a new way to communicate their needs instead of engaging in the problem behavior.

This could be a simple communicative phrase or action (often called an “omnibus mand”) that effectively replaces behaviors like aggression or elopement.

For example, a student who used to scream or hit to escape work learns to appropriately request a break or ask for help using a card, device, or phrase.

When they use the FCR, they immediately contact the reinforcement (e.g. break, attention), so they experience that this new skill reliably works  .
Tolerance Response (TR): Next, the student is taught to tolerate delays or denials of reinforcement.

Real-life cannot always grant immediate escape or attention, so the student practices handling a brief period of not getting what they want after making their request.

During SBT, the BCBA introduces incremental challenges – for instance, after the student asks for a break, the teacher might say “Okay, in a minute,” gradually increasing the wait time.

The student is reinforced for tolerating this delay without resorting to problem behavior (this often involves teaching calming strategies or providing some alternative engagement during the wait)  .

Over time, this builds the student’s emotional resilience and patience.
Contextually Appropriate Behaviors (CAB): Finally, the student is taught to cooperate with typical demands and routines – essentially, to engage in appropriate behaviors even while they are waiting for reinforcement.

SBT uses a systematic shaping procedure to teach multiple levels of cooperation or task engagement (often numbered CAB1 through CAB5/6).

For example, CAB steps might include: (1) calmly handing over a preferred item when asked, (2) transitioning to a work area, (3) completing a short task, (4) doing more complex or varied tasks, and (5) persisting through challenges or larger work demands .

Each step is introduced gradually after the student has learned to request and tolerate, ensuring they feel successful and safe at each stage.

The BCBA reinforces each small approximation lavishly at first (with the functionally relevant rewards), often on a variable schedule to promote durable learning (i.e. not every single occurrence is reinforced, to mirror real-life unpredictability) .
Throughout SBT, the BCBA uses strategies like differential reinforcement (rewarding desired behaviors and not rewarding the problem behavior), environmental modifications to prevent triggers, and continued choice/control for the student (the student is given opportunities to make choices, take breaks, etc., which increases their willingness to participate).

Importantly, safety precautions (such as crisis plans or protective equipment) are in place in case the student has difficulty at any phase – though with PFA/IISCA and SBT’s design, severe crises are much less frequent than under traditional methods .
Evidence Base: Like PFA, Skill-Based Treatment has a robust and growing evidence base supporting its effectiveness across ages and diagnoses.

Hanley et al. (2014) first demonstrated that teaching communication and tolerance skills after a synthesized functional analysis led to large reductions (>90%) in problem behaviors in children with autism .

Subsequent studies have replicated these results in clinic, home, and school settings.

For instance, Ghaemmaghami et al. (2016) and Jessel et al. (2018) reported socially significant reductions in problem behaviors by using SBT after an IISCA, even in outpatient and school contexts.

A 2021 review by Coffey et al. (2021) documented that the PFA/SBT approach maintained its effectiveness for individuals with co-occurring autism and mental health disorders, underscoring its broad applicability .

Moreover, researchers have noted the humane, assent-based nature of SBT – because it emphasizes choice, safety, and dignity, it aligns with trauma-informed care and tends to produce high rates of learner engagement (Rajaraman et al., 2022).

In practice, many BCBAs have reported “life-changing” outcomes where students who once required daily restraints or exclusions are now calmly participating in class, using communication instead of aggression (as evidenced in published case studies and success stories in the PFA/SBT literature).
BCBA Action – How to Implement SBT: In a real-world school scenario, a BCBA would use the PFA results to design a behavior support plan with the following actionable steps: (1) Teach the student an easy communication (the FCR) to replace the problem behavior – e.g. a hand signal or phrase like “I need a break.” Ensure all staff honor this request immediately at first, so the student trusts it. (2) Once the FCR is established, begin introducing tolerance training – occasionally have staff politely delay the student’s request (“I can help you in one minute”), and reinforce the student for waiting calmly (perhaps with praise, a timer to visualize the wait, and then fulfilling the request). (3) Simultaneously, start teaching simple cooperation skills in a structured manner: for example, the BCBA might create a task ladder that starts with very easy tasks or brief compliance (like handing an item) and gradually increases to doing classwork for several minutes.

The student is guided through these steps with frequent reinforcement and no punishment for errors – if problem behavior occurs, the BCBA treats it as communication (honoring the request or adjusting the demand) and then perhaps steps back to an easier level.

Through many short, positive practice sessions, the student builds a history of success and trust in the new system.

The BCBA also ensures that natural reinforcement (e.g. teacher attention, breaks built into the routine) is programmed into the student’s day so that over time, the extrinsic rewards can be thinned and the new skills generalize to normal class activities .

Throughout, data are collected on the frequency of problem behavior and the use of new skills, so the team can celebrate progress and adjust the plan if needed.

Crucially, the BCBA coaches teachers to implement all these steps with consistency and compassion – in essence, the BCBA is training the school staff to use SBT methods throughout the day, not just doing it themselves in isolation.

## Acceptance and Commitment Training (ACT) in Tier 3 Supports
While PFA and SBT directly target student behavior, Acceptance and Commitment Training (ACT) is an evidence-based practice that can greatly support Tier 3 implementation by addressing the behavior of the adults and the social-emotional context around the student.

ACT is rooted in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, a behavioral approach that teaches psychological flexibility – the ability to experience difficult thoughts or feelings while still acting in ways consistent with one’s values (Hayes et al., 1999).

In a school PBIS context, ACT techniques can be applied as training for teachers, staff, and even BCBAs themselves to handle the stress and challenges of working with severe behaviors (Tarbox et al., 2020) .

The goal is to prevent burnout and improve implementation fidelity by helping adults respond to student behavior with calm, values-driven actions rather than emotional reactivity or avoidance.
ACT for Staff: Research shows that teachers of students with challenging behavior often experience high stress and are at risk for burnout and attrition (Biglan et al., 2013) .

ACT-based interventions have been found effective in reducing such stress.

For example, Biglan et al. (2013) conducted a randomized trial where early childhood special education teachers attended ACT workshops.

Results indicated significant reductions in teachers’ stress, burnout, and experiential avoidance, and increases in mindful awareness and sense of efficacy, compared to a control group .

In a more recent study focused on K–12 teachers, Raaymakers (2022) implemented an ACT training plus follow-up activities for teachers in self-contained classrooms.

The training taught core ACT processes (e.g. acceptance of unpleasant feelings, defusion from negative thoughts, clarifying professional values, and committing to action).

The study found that after the ACT intervention, teachers reported lower psychological distress and had more positive interactions with students, along with fewer negative interactions .

In other words, ACT helped teachers stay present and supportive even when student behaviors were challenging, rather than reacting with frustration or giving up.

This is vital for Tier 3: a well-crafted behavior plan is only as good as the consistency and positivity with which staff carry it out.

By increasing teachers’ psychological flexibility, ACT enables them to implement behavior plans more faithfully (e.g. sticking to reinforcement schedules, ignoring provocation, using de-escalation strategies) and to maintain compassionate engagement with the student over the long haul.
ACT for BCBAs and Teams: BCBAs themselves can benefit from ACT to manage their own stress and model psychological flexibility for others.

The nature of Tier 3 work – dealing with severe aggression, self-injury, or emotional crises – can be stressful for practitioners.

A 2023 study by Slowiak and Jay found that high work demands and burnout are common among behavior analysts, and that psychological flexibility training can be a useful component of burnout prevention programs .

In fact, they suggest that organizations provide such training as part of supporting staff well-being .

By practicing ACT techniques (like mindfulness, reframing unhelpful thoughts, and reconnecting with the values of helping students), BCBAs can reduce the likelihood of burnout and remain effective leaders of Tier 3 supports (Slowiak & Jay, 2023) .

Moreover, BCBAs trained in ACT can incorporate its principles when supervising others – for instance, coaching a paraeducator to notice feelings of frustration as just feelings (not reasons to quit trying), to accept that some days will be tough, and to remember their value of making a difference for the student (thus re-energizing their commitment to the plan).

This kind of ACT-informed coaching can improve staff resilience and consistency, which directly benefits the student (because the behavior plan is implemented more reliably).

In summary, ACT is a powerful adjunct to Tier 3 behavior support: it equips the human beings around the student to handle stress in healthy ways and to persist with positive behavior support strategies, even under pressure (Tarbox et al., 2020) .
ACT for Students (Individualized): In some cases, especially with older students who have internalizing issues (anxiety, depression) or language skills, BCBAs might directly use ACT techniques with the students as a Tier 3 intervention.

For example, a high school student with anxiety-driven school refusal might receive ACT-based counseling to learn acceptance of anxious feelings and commitment to attending school in service of personal goals.

While such interventions are often done by school counselors or psychologists, behavior-analytic ACT programs (focused on overt behavior change via increased psychological flexibility) can fall within a BCBA’s scope (Tarbox et al., 2020) .

The BCBA would ensure these interventions are data-driven and integrated with the student’s behavior support plan.

For instance, a student could be taught to notice and rate their urge to escape class on a scale, take a short mindful breath, and then choose a valued action (like staying 5 more minutes to earn a preferred activity later).

This would complement function-based strategies (like break passes) by addressing the student’s private events (thoughts/feelings) that influence behavior.

The empirical support here comes from broader ACT research in schools and clinical settings showing improvements in adolescents’ coping skills and reductions in problem behaviors when ACT is applied (see Payne et al., 2022 for a review).
In sum, ACT adds a crucial “people support” layer to Tier 3 PBIS: it helps the adults (and sometimes students) accept the inevitable difficulties in behavior change and stay committed to implementing positive practices.

This leads to more durable and effective intervention outcomes.

## Real-World Implementation Models
Bringing together PFA, SBT, and ACT, we can envision a real-world model of Tier 3 PBIS implementation in a school district:
Referral and Team Formation: A student who exhibits persistent, dangerous behavior (e.g. daily aggressive outbursts) is referred to the Tier 3 team.

The BCBA convenes an individualized support team including the student’s teachers, parents, a school psychologist or counselor, and any relevant service providers (e.g. speech therapist if communication is involved) .

An administrator ensures resources and support.

The team adopts a wraparound approach, meaning they will consider supports across home and community as needed, not just at school  .
Assessment (PFA): The BCBA leads a Practical Functional Assessment for the student.

For example, they interview the teacher and family and learn that the student’s aggression typically occurs when difficult academic demands are placed and usually results in the student being sent out of class (escaping work) and getting one-on-one adult attention later.

With team input, the BCBA designs an IISCA conducted in a controlled setting (perhaps the resource room when other students are not present).

In that session, the BCBA might present a challenging task and lightly prompt the student to work; when the student begins to show precursor signs of frustration (frowning, raising voice), the BCBA immediately says “Let’s take a break” and gives comforting attention, thus testing the escape+attention contingency.

If the problem behavior subsides and the student becomes calm (indicating the hypothesized reinforcers worked), the analysis confirms the function.

The whole process may take just 20 minutes to yield clear results (much faster than a standard FA) .

The BCBA also assesses any skill deficits contributing to the behavior – e.g. perhaps the student lacks an appropriate way to request help or has not learned coping skills for frustration.
Planning (BIP Design): Based on the PFA findings, the BCBA develops a Behavior Intervention Plan with Skill-Based Treatment at its core.

The plan specifies preventive strategies (e.g. adjust difficulty of work, provide choices, pre-teach challenging tasks to build confidence), and then the teaching and reinforcement strategy: the student will be taught to raise a “break” card when work is hard.

Staff will immediately allow a short break and give praise for using the card (meeting the escape and attention needs).

Over time, the plan will require the student to do a bit more work (shaping tolerance) before earning the break.

The plan also includes reinforcement for task completion (e.g. earning points toward a preferred activity) to motivate engagement.

It clearly outlines how to respond if problem behavior occurs (often, the plan might say to honor the communicated need even if the student didn’t use the card perfectly, and then review/practice the skill when calm).

A safety/crisis procedure is detailed as well, ensuring staff know how to keep everyone safe and use minimal restraint/seclusion if the student becomes dangerous (though the emphasis is on preventing escalation through the positive plan)  .

The BCBA writes this up in a user-friendly way and checks that it fits the school context and the family’s input (cultural and contextual fit are considered ).
Staff Training and Coaching: The BCBA now invests time in training those who work with the student (teachers, aides, specialists) to carry out the plan.

Using behavior skills training (BST) principles, the BCBA might explain the rationale (why the student behaves this way and how the new plan addresses it), then model the procedures (e.g. role-play a scenario where an aide acts as the student using the break card, and the BCBA demonstrates giving immediate reinforcement).

Staff then rehearse the scenarios and the BCBA provides feedback until everyone is fluent and confident.

This training also involves setting up data collection systems (like a simple tally for each class period: Did the student raise the card? How many tasks completed? Any aggression incidents?).

The BCBA might also introduce ACT techniques in a brief workshop during training: for example, acknowledging that dealing with aggressive behavior is stressful and encouraging staff to notice their own emotional responses.

The BCBA could help staff identify their values (“We all want the student to be successful and safe”) and discuss how implementing this plan, even when inconvenient, ties to those values.

Staff learn quick ACT strategies, such as taking a deep breath and defusing thoughts (“He’s doing this to me on purpose”) into more helpful ones (“He’s having a hard time, not trying to give me a hard time”).

This prepares the team to remain calm and consistent if the student tests boundaries.
Implementation and Monitoring: With the plan in place, the student starts receiving the interventions in everyday routines.

For instance, each morning during a tough academic block, the teacher preps the student by saying “Remember, use your break card if you need it.

I believe you can do this work – and we’ll work through it together.” The student is given tasks; as soon as they raise the card (or even look anxious), the teacher responds exactly as trained (immediate break and attention).

Over the days, the BCBA gradually coaches the teacher to delay reinforcement by small amounts – perhaps asking the student to finish one more problem before the break.

The student, now trusting that help will come, manages this small delay (with praise for doing so).

If the student engages in the desired appropriate behaviors, they are positively reinforced (social praise, points, etc.), and problem behavior is not rewarded (if an outburst happens, the team follows the plan: ensure safety, then remind the skill – but crucially they try to avoid inadvertently letting the outburst escape the work entirely without the appropriate request).

The BCBA or support staff might shadow the student initially to prompt and reinforce, fading back as the teacher takes over.

All the while, data are collected: each incident of problem behavior, each successful use of the break card, duration of on-task behavior, etc., as well as fidelity data (are staff following each step of the plan?).

The BCBA reviews data with the team at least weekly.
Adjustments and Fading: The team meets regularly to review progress.

Suppose after a month, data show the student’s aggressive incidents have dropped from daily to maybe one brief episode per week, and they are using the break card appropriately multiple times a day.

This is great progress.

If an aspect isn’t improving, the BCBA problem-solves with the team (e.g. “We see math class still triggers him – maybe the work is too hard; let’s modify it further and practice the tolerance skill more in that context.”).

As the student improves, the BCBA guides the fading of intensive supports: for example, once the student can work 20 minutes with only one break, the break card might be made available only at natural break times, or the points system might be thinned to more intermittent rewards .

The ultimate goal is to transition the student out of Tier 3 back to Tier 2 or Tier 1 support (as noted by the Tier 3 team, the goal is always to reduce the need for intensive support over time)  .

Fading is done carefully with student input – maybe having them set goals for how long they can work, and building self-management skills.

If applicable, the BCBA also coordinates with the student’s family to make sure the same communication or coping skills are encouraged at home (providing consistency and generalization).

The wraparound approach might involve connecting the family to outside counseling (if the student has anxiety or trauma) or other community supports, so that gains in school carry over to overall well-being .
This integrated model shows how PFA, SBT, and ACT come together in practice: PFA gives a clear understanding of the behavior, SBT provides the therapy to replace that behavior with skills, and ACT fortifies the implementers (and sometimes the student) to handle the process with resilience.

Real-world examples of this model exist.

For instance, in districts that have adopted Dr.

Hanley’s approach, schools report dramatic decreases in restraint and seclusion after training staff in PFA/SBT and providing ACT coaching for teachers.

Another model is the research project by Whelan et al. (2021) where they conducted a seminar-based training for school staff on PFA/SBT; it resulted in staff independently carrying out functional analyses and interventions with high fidelity and success .

These models illustrate that with proper training and support, school-based teams can effectively implement these cutting-edge, evidence-based Tier 3 practices.

## Specific Actionable Tasks for BCBAs
Finally, here is a checklist of specific tasks a BCBA can carry out when leveraging PFA, SBT, and ACT in a K–12 public school setting:
Conduct a Comprehensive FBA using PFA: Lead an interview-informed functional assessment for each referred student.

This includes interviewing stakeholders, formulating hypotheses about behavior function, and running a practical functional analysis to confirm those functions in a safe, time-efficient manner  .

Deliverable: A summary of triggers and reinforcers maintaining the problem behavior, with supporting data.
Develop an Individualized Behavior Support Plan (BSP): Create a written plan based on the FBA that outlines function-linked interventions .

Ensure the plan has proactive strategies (antecedent modifications), Skill-Based Treatment components (teaching communication, tolerance, and coping skills), and consequence strategies (reinforcement schedules for desired behavior, response to problem behavior)  .

Deliverable: BSP document (often part of the student’s IEP or 504 plan) listing goals, procedures, and roles.
Incorporate Trauma-Informed and Choice-Based Elements: Make sure the intervention strategies are trauma-sensitive and respect the student’s dignity.

For example, design the teaching environment to be assent-based (the student has a way to indicate if they need a break), avoid triggers that cause panic or re-traumatization, and focus on positive reinforcement over punishment  .

Deliverable: Evidence in the plan of student choices, gradual exposure, and emphasis on feeling “safe, happy, and ready to engage” during interventions .
Train School Staff and Caregivers: Provide hands-on training to everyone who will implement the plan – teachers, aides, bus drivers, parents, etc.

Use modeling, role-play, and feedback to ensure they can confidently execute the prevention strategies and SBT procedures (e.g. how to prompt the communication, how to respond to the tolerance signal, how to handle an outburst) (Center on PBIS, 2022)  .

Deliverable: Training sessions completed (document dates, attendees) and staff demonstration of competence (e.g. via a fidelity checklist role-play).
Coach and Support through ACT Principles: Embed Acceptance and Commitment Training in your ongoing coaching.

For staff, this means encouraging them to voice challenges, normalizing those feelings (stress or frustration), and guiding them in brief ACT exercises – such as identifying their values as educators, practicing mindfulness or breathing during challenging moments, and using positive self-talk.

The BCBA might, for instance, start each team meeting with a 2-minute mindfulness exercise or share an “ACT quick tip” in staff emails.

Deliverable: Evidence of ACT integration – e.g. a staff self-report survey on stress before and after coaching, or simply qualitative feedback that teachers feel “heard and equipped” to handle tough days  .
Collect and Analyze Data Continuously: Establish data collection methods for both student outcomes and implementation fidelity (are we doing what we said we’d do?).

For student behavior, use frequency or duration tracking for problem behaviors and replacement skills (like number of successful task completions, number of break requests, etc.).

Also use rating scales for social-emotional measures if relevant (e.g. how anxious the student was today, to gauge internal progress).

For fidelity, use checklists during observations (did the teacher follow each step of the plan?).

Regularly graph these data and bring them to team meetings  .

Deliverable: Updated graphs and reports showing trends (e.g. a decreasing line for aggression, increasing line for work completion).
Use Data for Decision Making: Convene the team frequently (at least bi-weekly initially) to review the data.

Make data-based decisions on plan adjustments: if the data show improvement, decide when to fade prompts or add new challenges; if data are flat or worsening, troubleshoot why (does the hypothesis need revising? Is fidelity low? Do we need a new reinforcement?).

For example, if the student’s aggression plateaus, the BCBA might decide to revisit the functional assessment or try a different motivator.

Deliverable: Meeting notes that document decisions and rationale based on the data (e.g. “Will increase reinforcement for tolerance behavior because data showed slight increase in refusals when demands got harder”).
Generalize and Fade Supports: Plan for generalization of skills across settings and people.

The BCBA might have the student practice the new skills in different classrooms, with different teachers, or on the bus, and ensure those staff are trained too.

They also gradually fade out extra supports: for instance, move from a dense reinforcement schedule to a more natural one, or fade the use of a break card if the student learns to self-advocate verbally .

The BCBA should set criteria for fading (e.g. 4 weeks with no aggressive incidents) and then implement a stepwise reduction in support.

Eventually, the student should be incorporated back into Tier 1/2 interventions with only occasional Tier 3 check-ins.

Deliverable: A fade-out or step-down plan, and data showing the student maintained gains after each step of fading.
Document Outcomes and Share Success: As a BCBA, maintain documentation of the outcomes (e.g. before/after rates of behavior, academic engagement improvements, disciplinary referrals reduced).

Share these with stakeholders and celebrate the student’s progress.

Also, reflect on any lessons learned to improve future Tier 3 cases.

This might include writing a summary for school leadership on how the PFA/SBT approach worked, potentially advocating for its use with other students.

Deliverable: A final report or presentation highlighting the student’s growth (for example, “Aggression reduced by 90%, from 10 incidents per week to 1 or fewer, and instructional time increased accordingly” ), with testimonials from the teacher or parent if appropriate.
By following these tasks, a BCBA ensures that Tier 3 supports are not only individualized and evidence-based, but also sustainably implemented.

The combined use of PFA, SBT, and ACT addresses both the technical side of behavior support (identifying functions and teaching skills) and the human side (supporting the implementers’ and student’s emotional needs and acceptance).

This comprehensive approach has been shown to lead to real-world success, transforming the lives of students with severe challenges and empowering school teams with effective tools (Hanley et al., 2014 ; Tarbox et al., 2020 ).

It exemplifies the ultimate goal of Tier 3 PBIS: every student gets the support they need to thrive behaviorally, socially, and academically, in a positive and inclusive school environment.
