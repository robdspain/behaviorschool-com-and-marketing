*Edited by Rob Spain, BCBA, IBA*

Supervision is one of the most important (and most time-consuming) parts of being a school-based BCBA. Whether you are supervising RBTs, paraprofessionals, BCaBAs, or graduate students pursuing their fieldwork hours, understanding BACB requirements and how they apply in school settings is critical.

This guide breaks down the current supervision requirements, the unique challenges school BCBAs face, and strategies to stay compliant without drowning in documentation.

## Who School BCBAs Typically Supervise

Unlike clinic BCBAs who mostly supervise RBTs delivering 1:1 therapy, school BCBAs often supervise a mix of:

- **RBTs** (Registered Behavior Technicians implementing BIPs)
- **Paraprofessionals and instructional aides** (providing behavior support but not certified)
- **BCaBAs** (Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analysts, less common in schools)
- **Graduate students** completing fieldwork hours toward BCBA certification
- **Classroom teachers** implementing behavior plans (consultation, not formal supervision)

Each supervisee type has different requirements. Let is break them down.

## RBT Supervision Requirements

If you supervise RBTs in a school setting, you must follow the BACB RBT supervision guidelines.

### Contact Hours

- **Minimum 5% of the hours the RBT provides behavior-analytic services per month**
- At least **2 face-to-face contacts per month** (in-person or synchronous virtual)
- At least **1 on-site observation** of the RBT with a client per month

**Example:** If your RBT works 20 hours per week (80 hours per month) providing services, you owe them a minimum of 4 hours of supervision per month (5% of 80).

### What Counts as Supervision

Supervision must include:

- Observation of the RBT implementing interventions
- Feedback on performance
- Review of data and client progress
- Discussion of ethical and professional conduct
- Modeling and skill development

**What does NOT count:**

- Staff meetings where behavior plans are discussed generally
- Emails or texts
- The RBT working independently without observation or feedback

### Documentation Requirements

You must maintain records for each supervision contact:

- Date and duration
- Supervisee name
- Type of contact (observation, meeting, feedback)
- Summary of what was covered
- Supervisee and supervisor signatures (or electronic confirmation)

These records can be requested during BACB audits. Keep them for at least 7 years.

### School-Specific Challenges for RBT Supervision

**Challenge 1: RBTs split across multiple sites**

Your RBT may be at 3 different schools throughout the week. Scheduling on-site observations is a logistical nightmare.

**Solution:** Block specific observation days. For example, "I observe at Lincoln Elementary every Tuesday morning." Let RBTs and site staff know your schedule in advance.

**Challenge 2: RBTs are pulled for other duties**

Paras and aides (even if they are RBTs) get pulled for yard duty, lunch supervision, bus duty, or coverage. You show up for a scheduled observation and they are not with the student.

**Solution:** Communicate with site administrators that RBT supervision is a certification requirement, not optional. Document when you attempt observations but the RBT is unavailable. If it happens repeatedly, it is a systems issue that needs to be escalated.

**Challenge 3: RBTs working with multiple students**

Unlike clinic 1:1 sessions, school RBTs may support 5-10 students in a day. Do you need to observe each student?

**BACB clarification:** You need to observe the RBT providing services, but you do not need to observe every single student every month. Rotate which students you observe, ensuring you see each student at least once per quarter.

## BCaBA Supervision Requirements

If you supervise a BCaBA (less common in schools, but it happens):

- **Minimum 5% of the hours worked per month**
- At least **2 contacts per month**
- At least **1 in-person contact per month**

The supervision content is similar to RBT supervision but at a higher clinical level (BCaBAs can design interventions, conduct assessments, and supervise RBTs under your oversight).

## Fieldwork Supervision for Graduate Students

If you are supervising a graduate student accumulating hours toward BCBA certification, the requirements are more intensive.

### Supervised Fieldwork Hours

Students need **1,500 hours** (concentrated) or **2,000 hours** (extended) of supervised fieldwork.

### Supervision Contact Requirements

- **Concentrated pathway:** Minimum 10% supervision contacts (at least 150 hours total), with 60+ hours one-to-one, 90+ hours group
- **Extended pathway:** Minimum 6% supervision contacts (at least 120 hours total), with 60+ hours one-to-one, 60+ hours group

### What Counts as Fieldwork Hours

Only hours where the supervisee is engaging in behavior-analytic activities count:

- Conducting assessments (FBA, skill assessments)
- Designing and implementing interventions
- Analyzing data and writing reports
- Direct client interaction
- Supervision (receiving feedback, case discussions)

**What does NOT count:**

- General staff meetings
- Non-behavior-analytic tasks (filing, scheduling, copying)
- Hours before the supervision contract is signed
- Travel time (unless providing services during travel, like coaching in the car)

### Supervision Contract

You must have a signed supervision contract with the supervisee that includes:

- Start and end dates
- Responsibilities of supervisor and supervisee
- Terms for terminating the relationship
- Expectations and goals

The BACB provides a sample contract template.

### School-Specific Challenges for Fieldwork Supervision

**Challenge 1: Student is also a paraprofessional**

Many grad students work as instructional aides while completing fieldwork. Not all their work hours count as fieldwork hours.

**Solution:** Clearly delineate which hours are behavior-analytic (conducting FBAs, implementing BIPs, collecting data) vs. general instructional support (helping with reading groups, supervising lunch). Only the former count.

**Challenge 2: Limited one-to-one supervision time**

Schools are fast-paced. Finding uninterrupted time for one-to-one supervision is hard.

**Solution:** Schedule it like you would an IEP meeting. Block the time, treat it as non-negotiable, and use it for case discussions, ethics, and feedback.

**Challenge 3: Supervisee works in a different district**

Some BCBAs supervise students who work in other school districts. This is allowed, but it requires coordination.

**Solution:** Use secure video conferencing for some contacts (allowed for fieldwork supervision). Schedule in-person observations at least monthly.

## Supervision vs. Consultation: Know the Difference

School BCBAs often consult with teachers on behavior plans. This is not the same as supervision.

| Supervision | Consultation |
|-------------|--------------|
| Ongoing relationship with defined roles | As-needed support |
| Formal documentation required | Documentation optional |
| Supervisee is implementing ABA under your oversight | Teacher is implementing strategies you recommend but they own the plan |
| You are responsible for the supervisee's behavior-analytic work | Teacher retains responsibility for instruction |
| BACB ethics code applies | Professional collaboration applies |

**Example:** If you train a teacher on a token economy for their class, that is consultation. If an RBT is implementing a BIP you designed and you observe and give feedback monthly, that is supervision.

## Documentation Systems That Actually Work

Keeping track of supervision contacts across 5 RBTs, 2 grad students, and multiple sites is a paperwork disaster waiting to happen. Here are systems that work:

### 1. Shared Supervision Log (Google Sheets or Excel)

Create a simple shared log with columns:

- Date
- Supervisee name
- Duration
- Type (observation, meeting, feedback)
- Summary
- Signatures

Both you and the supervisee can access it. Update it immediately after each contact.

### 2. Monthly Supervision Meetings

Schedule recurring monthly meetings with each supervisee. Use the same time slot every month (e.g., "First Tuesday at 3pm"). Treat it like an IEP meeting: non-negotiable.

### 3. Supervision Trackers per Supervisee

Give each supervisee a tracker where they log their own hours worked and request supervision when they hit thresholds (e.g., "I worked 80 hours this month, I need 4 hours of supervision").

### 4. Use a Digital Platform

If you supervise multiple people, a platform like [supervision.behaviorschool.com](https://supervision.behaviorschool.com) can automate tracking, send reminders, and generate reports for BACB audits. It saves hours of manual tracking.

## Common Supervision Mistakes School BCBAs Make

### 1. Counting Staff Meetings as Supervision

A weekly team meeting where you discuss students is not individual supervision. Supervision must include observation, feedback, and skill development specific to the supervisee.

### 2. Not Documenting Informal Contacts

You give an RBT feedback during a hallway conversation. It was only 5 minutes, so you do not document it. Those minutes add up, and if you get audited, they do not count unless documented.

**Fix:** Keep a running note on your phone. At the end of each day, transfer it to your supervision log.

### 3. Supervision Drift

You start strong in September with weekly observations and feedback. By March, you have not observed in 6 weeks because of IEP season.

**Fix:** Put supervision observations on your calendar as recurring events. Treat them like IEP meetings: they do not get bumped.

### 4. Not Addressing Performance Issues

A supervisee is not implementing the BIP correctly, but you avoid giving corrective feedback because it is uncomfortable.

**Fix:** Supervision includes feedback, both positive and corrective. Use specific, observable language ("I noticed you delivered the token before the student completed the task. Let us review the contingency") and model the correct approach.

## Ethics and Supervision

The BACB Ethics Code has an entire section on supervision (Section 5). Key points:

- **5.01 Supervisory Competence:** Only supervise within your scope of competence.
- **5.02 Supervisory Volume:** Only take on the number of supervisees you can adequately oversee.
- **5.03 Supervisory Delegation:** You can delegate some supervision tasks (e.g., a BCaBA observes an RBT) but you remain responsible.
- **5.04 Designing Effective Supervision:** Provide feedback, modeling, and opportunities for skill development.

If you are supervising 10 RBTs across 8 school sites and cannot meet the 5% requirement for all of them, you are out of compliance. It is better to reduce your supervisory load than to do it poorly.

## RBT PDU Requirements (New as of January 2026)

As of January 2026, RBTs must earn **12 PDU hours per 2-year recertification cycle**. This is separate from supervision.

**What counts as PDUs:**
- Conferences, workshops, webinars
- In-service training delivered by a BCBA (yes, you can provide PDUs for your own RBTs)
- College courses related to ABA

**What does NOT count:**
- Supervision contacts (those are separate)
- Training specific to one client or one BIP

**Your role as supervisor:** You can provide PDU-eligible in-service training (e.g., a monthly 1-hour training on a specific topic: ethics, data collection, function-based interventions). Document the training, and your RBTs can count it toward their PDU hours.

**Resource:** [BehaviorSchool offers affordable RBT PDU courses](https://learning.behaviorschool.com) designed for school-based RBTs.

## How to Reduce Supervision Burden Without Cutting Corners

Supervision is important, but it can also consume 10-15 hours per week if you have a large team. Here is how to be efficient:

### 1. Group Supervision

For fieldwork supervisees, you can count group supervision (up to 10 supervisees in a group). Host a monthly case discussion meeting where supervisees present cases, discuss ethics, and get feedback. This counts toward their supervision hours.

### 2. Observation Rotation

If you supervise RBTs at the same site, observe two in one visit. You do not need to observe the same RBT every month if you have multiple supervisees. Rotate so everyone is observed at least once per quarter.

### 3. Video Review

For some supervision contacts, ask the supervisee to record a session (with appropriate consent) and review it together during your meeting. This is more flexible than live observation and allows for detailed feedback.

### 4. Combine Supervision with Site Visits

If you are already at a school to observe a student or attend an IEP, schedule your RBT supervision immediately before or after. Batch your site visits.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I supervise RBTs who are not implementing ABA interventions?

No. Supervision requires the supervisee to be engaging in behavior-analytic activities. If an RBT is only doing general instructional support (helping with reading, supervising recess), those hours do not count, and you are not required to provide RBT supervision.

### Do I need separate liability insurance to supervise?

Check your employer's liability policy. Many school districts cover BCBAs for supervision activities within the scope of employment. If you supervise someone outside your district or do private supervision, you may need additional coverage.

### Can I supervise someone in a different state?

Yes, if you hold BCBA certification in that state (or it is not required). Check state-specific rules. Some states (like California) do not require BCBAs to be licensed, so supervision can cross state lines more easily.

### What happens if my supervisee is not meeting requirements?

Document performance concerns, provide feedback and a plan for improvement, and set a timeline. If they do not improve, you can terminate the supervision relationship. This must be done ethically and in accordance with your supervision contract.

### How do I prepare for a BACB supervision audit?

Keep organized records: supervision contracts, contact logs with dates/times/signatures, and any correspondence. If audited, the BACB will request documentation proving you met contact hour and observation requirements.
