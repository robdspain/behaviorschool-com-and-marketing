*Edited by Rob Spain, BCBA, IBA*

Starting January 2026, the BACB requires all RBTs to complete 12 Professional Development Units (PDUs) every two years to maintain certification.

For school-based teams, this is a big shift. Many districts have never tracked PDU hours, and most RBTs do not know what counts. BCBAs are now expected to guide their RBTs through compliance without adding more paperwork to an already heavy workload.

This guide breaks down the requirements, what counts, what does not, and how you can provide PDUs for your own RBTs without violating BACB or district policies.

## Quick Summary of the 2026 RBT PDU Requirements

- **Requirement begins:** January 2026
- **Total hours required:** 12 PDUs per 2-year recertification cycle
- **Supervision does NOT count** toward PDUs
- **Client-specific training does NOT count**
- **BCBAs CAN deliver in-service PDUs** for their own RBTs
- **Documentation is required** for each PDU activity

This requirement is separate from the existing RBT supervision requirements.

## Why the BACB Added PDUs for RBTs

The BACB introduced PDUs to ensure ongoing competency and ethical practice for RBTs. In schools, RBTs often work with high-needs students and implement complex behavior plans. Continuing education helps keep their skills current and aligned with evidence-based practice.

This also aligns with the BACB Ethics Code, which emphasizes competence and ongoing professional development for anyone providing behavior-analytic services.

## What Counts as an RBT PDU

PDUs must be related to behavior analysis and professional practice. Examples include:

- ABA workshops or webinars
- Conferences or professional trainings
- In-service training delivered by a BCBA
- Coursework related to behavior analysis
- Trainings on data collection, ethics, or function-based interventions

**Important:** PDUs must be educational, not just informational. A 30-minute staff meeting about schedule changes does not count.

## What Does NOT Count

This is where most teams get tripped up:

- **Supervision contacts** (required 5% supervision is separate)
- **Client-specific training** (reviewing a single student's BIP does not count)
- **General staff meetings**
- **Lunch duty or shadowing**
- **Non-ABA trainings** (district compliance, mandatory HR training)

If the training is not broadly applicable to behavior-analytic practice, it does not count.

## Can BCBAs Provide PDUs for Their Own RBTs?

Yes. The BACB explicitly allows BCBAs to provide PDUs for their own supervisees. This is good news for school teams because it means you can deliver PDUs in-house rather than sending RBTs to expensive external trainings.

**Examples of in-service PDU topics:**

- Data collection methods and fidelity
- Functional communication training
- De-escalation strategies aligned with function
- Ethical decision-making in schools
- Behavior plan implementation fidelity
- ABC data and hypothesis development

**Tip:** Create a monthly 1-hour training. Over a two-year cycle, you will easily hit the 12-hour requirement.

## PDU Documentation Requirements

You must document each PDU activity. The BACB expects:

- Date of training
- Duration (hours)
- Topic and content summary
- Instructor name and credentials
- List of attendees
- Proof of completion (certificate, sign-in sheet)

Keep records for at least 7 years. If an RBT is audited and cannot produce documentation, they may lose certification.

## How to Build a Simple PDU Plan for Your Team

Here is a practical plan for a school BCBA supervising 5-10 RBTs:

### Step 1: Map the 2-Year Cycle

Most RBTs have different renewal dates. Start by creating a tracker with:

- RBT name
- Renewal date
- Hours completed
- Hours remaining

### Step 2: Schedule Monthly In-Service Trainings

Hold a 1-hour training each month during a time that works for your team. Use the same day each month (for example, first Wednesday at 2:30pm).

### Step 3: Use a Standard Training Template

For each session, document:

- Objective (what they will learn)
- Content outline
- Activity or practice
- Quiz or discussion questions

This makes it easier to document and provide certificates.

### Step 4: Provide Certificates

At the end of each training, issue a simple certificate with:

- Training title
- Date
- Hours earned
- Instructor signature

### Step 5: Track Individual Hours

Use a shared spreadsheet or a supervision platform to track hours in real time.

## Sample 12-Hour PDU Plan (2-Year Cycle)

This example covers 12 PDUs with one hour per quarter plus occasional webinars.

1. **Ethics in school-based ABA** (1 hour)
2. **Data collection and fidelity checks** (1 hour)
3. **FBA basics and hypothesis statements** (1 hour)
4. **Function-based reinforcement strategies** (1 hour)
5. **Crisis prevention and de-escalation** (1 hour)
6. **ABA and trauma-informed practices** (1 hour)
7. **Functional communication training** (1 hour)
8. **IEP behavior goals and progress monitoring** (1 hour)
9. **School-wide PBIS strategies** (1 hour)
10. **RBT role boundaries and ethical decision-making** (1 hour)
11. **ACT-informed behavior support** (1 hour)
12. **End-of-cycle review and competency check** (1 hour)

Total: 12 hours

## School-Specific Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: No time for extra training

**Solution:** Build PDUs into existing professional development days or staff meetings. A 60-minute training once per month is realistic and keeps compliance manageable.

### Challenge 2: RBTs are split across sites

**Solution:** Use secure video conferencing for live trainings. Record sessions and allow RBTs to complete a short quiz for credit (if allowed by your district policy).

### Challenge 3: Documentation overload

**Solution:** Use a shared tracker or a platform like [learning.behaviorschool.com](https://learning.behaviorschool.com) which includes built-in certificates and tracking for PDUs.

## Relationship to Supervision Requirements

Supervision and PDUs are separate requirements:

- **Supervision:** 5% of hours worked per month, with observations and feedback
- **PDUs:** 12 hours per 2-year cycle, focused on professional development

Do not count supervision meetings toward PDUs, even if you are teaching something during supervision. Keep them separate in documentation to avoid compliance issues.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

The BACB Ethics Code requires supervisors to ensure supervisees meet certification requirements. That includes PDUs. As a BCBA, you are responsible for accurate guidance and documentation.

Also, remember FERPA. Do not include student names or confidential case details in PDU training materials unless they are securely stored and access is limited to authorized staff.

## How BehaviorSchool Can Help

BehaviorSchool offers school-relevant PDU courses for RBTs at [learning.behaviorschool.com](https://learning.behaviorschool.com). Courses include certificates, tracking, and topics aligned with school-based practice, not clinic-based case examples.

For supervision tracking and documentation, use [supervision.behaviorschool.com](https://supervision.behaviorschool.com).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do RBT PDUs replace supervision requirements?

No. PDUs are separate from supervision. RBTs must still receive 5% supervision per month with observations and feedback.

### Can a BCBA count a monthly supervision meeting as a PDU?

No. Supervision does not count as a PDU even if you discuss training topics. PDUs must be separate professional development activities.

### Do in-service trainings count if they are delivered by my own BCBA supervisor?

Yes, as long as the training is behavior-analytic, documented, and includes content beyond a single client case.

### What happens if an RBT does not complete 12 PDUs?

They may not be eligible for recertification and could lose their RBT credential. This impacts the district and the BCBA supervising them.

### How should RBTs track their PDUs?

Use a digital tracker with dates, topics, hours, and certificates. A shared spreadsheet works, but a platform like learning.behaviorschool.com simplifies documentation.
