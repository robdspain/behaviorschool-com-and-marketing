*Edited by Rob Spain, BCBA, IBA*

Tier 3 behavior support is where mistakes get expensive. When a student has high-risk behavior, the team needs a full FBA, a function-based BIP, and progress monitoring that can stand up in an IEP meeting or due process hearing.

The problem is that many school teams treat Tier 3 like a vague process. One person writes an FBA, another person writes a BIP, and no one connects the dots. That is how you end up with interventions that do not match the function, progress data that is inconsistent, and a plan that falls apart after three weeks.

This guide provides a complete, step-by-step workflow for moving from referral to FBA to BIP to progress monitoring in a way that is efficient, compliant, and effective.

## When Tier 3 Is Required

Tier 3 is appropriate when:

- Behavior is dangerous (aggression, elopement, self-injury)
- Behavior occurs frequently and disrupts learning
- The function is unclear or multiple functions are suspected
- Tier 1 and Tier 2 supports have not worked
- The student is at risk of change of placement (suspension days approaching 10)

Under IDEA, an FBA is required when behavior impedes learning and the team determines it is necessary to develop a BIP. It is also required when a change of placement is being considered due to disciplinary removals.

## Overview: The FBA to BIP Workflow

Here is the full Tier 3 workflow, followed by detailed steps:

1. Referral and initial screening
2. Consent and team roles
3. Record review and baseline data
4. Indirect assessment (interviews, rating scales)
5. Direct observation and ABC data
6. Hypothesis development
7. BIP design (prevention, teaching, consequence strategies)
8. Implementation plan and staff training
9. Progress monitoring system
10. Review and revision cycle

## Step 1: Referral and Initial Screening

**Goal:** Determine if Tier 3 is warranted and define the target behavior clearly.

**Actions:**
- Review referral information
- Clarify the target behavior in observable, measurable terms
- Confirm that Tier 1 and Tier 2 supports were attempted (if safe to do so)
- Determine if safety concerns require immediate Tier 3

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Behavior defined in observable terms
- [ ] Safety risk assessed
- [ ] Tier 1 and Tier 2 history reviewed
- [ ] Parent concerns documented

**Example:**

Instead of "defiance," define: "When given a teacher directive during independent work, the student puts head down, refuses to respond for more than 5 minutes, and pushes materials away." That is measurable.

## Step 2: Consent and Team Roles

**Goal:** Ensure legal compliance and clarify who does what.

Under IDEA, the IEP team must agree to conduct the FBA. Parent consent is required for formal evaluation in many districts. Check your district policy.

**Team roles:**
- **BCBA or behavior specialist:** Leads the FBA and develops the BIP
- **Teacher:** Provides daily data and implements interventions
- **Administrator:** Supports resources, scheduling, and enforcement
- **Parent:** Shares home context and collaborates on reinforcement
- **Related service staff:** Contribute (counselor, psychologist, OT)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Parent consent obtained
- [ ] Team members identified
- [ ] Timeline established (typical FBA timeline is 20-30 school days)

## Step 3: Record Review and Baseline Data

**Goal:** Understand the student context and establish baseline behavior rates.

**Records to review:**
- Previous IEPs and BIPs
- Discipline records
- Attendance and health records
- Academic data (grades, work samples)
- Previous evaluations

**Baseline data:**
- Frequency of behavior per day or week
- Duration of episodes
- Intensity rating (1-5 scale)
- Time and location patterns

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Records reviewed
- [ ] Baseline data collected for at least 5-10 school days
- [ ] Target behavior operationally defined

## Step 4: Indirect Assessment

**Goal:** Gather information from those who know the student best.

**Tools:**
- Teacher interviews (see [Teacher Input Forms for FBA](/blog/teacher-input-forms-for-fba))
- Parent interviews
- Student interview (when appropriate)
- Rating scales (MAS, FAST, QABF)

**Questions to answer:**
- When does the behavior occur most?
- When does it not occur?
- What typically happens after the behavior?
- What does the student gain or avoid?

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Teacher interview completed
- [ ] Parent interview completed
- [ ] Rating scale completed (optional)

## Step 5: Direct Observation and ABC Data

**Goal:** Confirm patterns and test hypotheses.

**Observation plan:**
- Observe in at least two settings (classroom, recess, transitions)
- Observe during times the behavior is most likely
- Collect at least 3-5 ABC sequences per setting
- Record latency, duration, and intensity when possible

**ABC data example:**

- **Antecedent:** Teacher assigns multi-step writing task
- **Behavior:** Student rips paper, yells, and leaves seat
- **Consequence:** Teacher removes assignment and sends student to calm-down area

**What this suggests:** Escape function reinforced by task removal.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Direct observation completed across settings
- [ ] ABC data collected
- [ ] Patterns identified

## Step 6: Hypothesis Development

**Goal:** Write a clear, testable hypothesis statement that guides intervention.

**Hypothesis format:**

"When [antecedent], the student [behavior] to [function]."

**Example:**

"When given multi-step writing assignments during independent work, the student tears paper and leaves their seat to escape a difficult task."

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Hypothesis statement written
- [ ] Team consensus on function
- [ ] Hypothesis aligns with data

## Step 7: BIP Design

**Goal:** Create a function-based intervention plan with prevention, teaching, and consequence strategies.

A strong BIP has three core components:

### 1. Prevention Strategies

Reduce the likelihood of problem behavior.

Examples:
- Modify task difficulty
- Provide visual schedules
- Offer choice of tasks or order
- Pre-correct expectations before transitions

### 2. Teaching Strategies

Teach replacement behaviors that serve the same function.

Examples:
- Teach student to request a break (escape function)
- Teach student to request attention appropriately (attention function)
- Teach self-regulation or coping skills

### 3. Consequence Strategies

Reinforce replacement behaviors and minimize reinforcement of problem behavior.

Examples:
- Provide immediate reinforcement when student requests a break
- Use planned ignoring for attention-seeking behavior (if safe)
- Ensure task is not removed when behavior occurs (if escape function)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Prevention strategies listed
- [ ] Replacement behaviors taught
- [ ] Reinforcement plan defined
- [ ] Consequences aligned with function

## Step 8: Implementation Plan and Staff Training

A perfect BIP fails if no one implements it correctly.

**Implementation plan should include:**
- Who will implement (teacher, aide, RBT)
- When and where strategies will be used
- Required materials (visuals, tokens, break cards)
- Training plan for staff

**Training checklist:**
- [ ] Staff receive written plan
- [ ] BCBA models strategies
- [ ] Staff practice with feedback
- [ ] Fidelity checks scheduled

**Note:** Under FERPA, keep all student data secure. Do not share BIP details via unsecured email or general AI tools.

## Step 9: Progress Monitoring System

**Goal:** Track whether the plan is working.

**What to measure:**
- Frequency of target behavior
- Frequency of replacement behavior
- Duration or intensity of episodes
- Academic engagement (optional)

**Data collection methods:**
- Daily point sheets
- Frequency counts
- Interval recording
- ABC data (periodic)

**Decision rules:**
- If behavior decreases by 50% after 4-6 weeks, continue and consider fading
- If no change after 4-6 weeks, revisit hypothesis and adjust plan
- If behavior escalates, reconvene team immediately

## Step 10: Review and Revision Cycle

Tier 3 is not "write it once and forget it." Plans must be reviewed regularly.

**Recommended review schedule:**
- 2 weeks after implementation
- 6 weeks after implementation
- Every 9 weeks (quarterly)

**Questions to ask:**
- Is the plan being implemented with fidelity?
- Is the behavior decreasing?
- Is the replacement behavior increasing?
- Does the student need additional supports?

If the plan is not working, revisit the FBA. Either the function is wrong or the interventions are not being implemented consistently.

## Common Tier 3 Mistakes

1. **Skipping baseline data:** You cannot measure progress without a baseline.
2. **Vague behavior definitions:** "Noncompliance" is not a behavior. Define what the student does.
3. **Mismatched interventions:** Teaching a break request will not work if the function is attention.
4. **No staff training:** A plan is only as good as its implementation.
5. **No data review:** If you are not reviewing data, you cannot adjust the plan.

## How BehaviorSchool Helps

The [BehaviorSchool FBA-to-BIP tool](/fba-to-bip) streamlines the entire Tier 3 workflow. It collects interview data, organizes observations, and generates a hypothesis-driven FBA report and function-based BIP with aligned goals and progress monitoring templates.

For Tier 1 and Tier 2 plans, use the [Behavior Plans tool](/behavior-plans) to keep your interventions aligned across tiers.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long should a Tier 3 FBA take?

A typical school-based FBA takes 20-30 school days from referral to completed report, depending on observation opportunities and data needs. For urgent safety concerns, you should start immediately and complete it as quickly as possible.

### Do we need parent consent for an FBA?

In most districts, yes, if the FBA is part of a formal evaluation. Check your district policy. If the FBA is part of ongoing services within the IEP, consent may already be covered.

### What if the behavior occurs rarely but is dangerous?

Even low-frequency behaviors require a full FBA if they pose significant safety risk. A single severe incident can be enough to justify Tier 3.

### Can a school psychologist conduct the FBA instead of a BCBA?

Yes, if they are trained in functional assessment and your state allows it. However, function-based intervention design is a specialized skill. If possible, involve a BCBA.

### How do I make sure the BIP is legally defensible?

Ensure the BIP is based on a documented FBA, includes clear behavior definitions, aligns interventions to function, includes data collection procedures, and is implemented with fidelity. Document all steps and team decisions.
