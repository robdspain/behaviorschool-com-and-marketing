If you've tried visiting BDS Modules recently and hit a DNS error or a blank page, you're not alone. A number of BCBA candidates have reported that bdsmodules.com has been unreachable for several weeks. Whether this is a temporary outage or something more permanent isn't clear, but if you're in the middle of exam prep, you can't afford to wait and find out.

This post isn't about piling on. BDS Modules has been a recognized name in BCBA study resources, and a lot of candidates have built their study plans around it. Losing access mid-prep is genuinely disruptive.

Here's what to think about as you look for an alternative.

## What You Need in a BCBA Study Platform

Not all exam prep tools are built the same. When evaluating an alternative, look for a few key features:

**Practice questions aligned to the BACB Task List.** The BCBA exam tests specific content domains — measurement, behavior assessment, behavior-change procedures, ethical considerations, and more. Your practice questions should map to those domains, not just cover general ABA concepts.

**Full-length mock exams with timing.** The actual BCBA exam is timed. Practicing under simulated exam conditions — same length, same pacing — builds the stamina and time management you'll need on test day.

**Domain-specific mini-exams.** If you're strong in some areas and weak in others, you need the ability to drill down into the specific domains where you're losing points. Broad practice helps, but targeted practice is what moves the needle late in your prep.

**Performance analytics.** You should be able to see your results broken down by domain so you know exactly where you stand. "I feel good about most of it" is not a prep strategy. Data is.

**Error review.** The questions you keep getting wrong are the ones that will show up on your exam. A platform that lets you systematically review your mistakes is worth more than one that just shows you your score.

## BehaviorSchool as an Alternative

[BehaviorSchool](https://study.behaviorschool.com) is an actively maintained BCBA exam prep platform that covers all of the above. Practice questions are organized by BACB content domain, full-length timed mock exams are available, and the analytics dashboard shows your performance by domain so you can adjust your study plan based on actual data — not guesswork.

It also includes SAFMEDS-style flashcard sessions for fluency-building, which is a legitimate evidence-based approach to learning behavioral concepts quickly.

There's a free tier to get started, so you can try it without committing.

## The Most Important Thing

Whatever platform you use, the most important factor in BCBA exam success is consistent daily practice. An hour of focused study every day beats a weekend cramming session every time. Pick a tool you can actually use every day, track your progress across domains, and adjust based on the data.

The exam is hard. The 2024 first-time pass rate was 54%. That's not a number to take lightly — but it's also not a reason to panic. Candidates who prepare systematically, identify their weak spots, and practice under realistic conditions pass at much higher rates.

Get back on a study plan. The exam isn't waiting.
