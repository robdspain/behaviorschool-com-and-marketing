Language is far more than just words—it is a behavior that plays a critical role in how we interact with our world.

Viewing language through a functional lens helps us understand its developmental progression and guides our design of effective, compassionate interventions.

When language is taught and reinforced appropriately, learners are more likely to engage with their environment rather than avoid challenges.

In this article, we describe targeted interventions for three stages of verbal behavior while noting that escape and avoidance behaviors can be present at every stage.

## The Importance of Assessing Verbal Behavior Stages
Before selecting interventions, it is critical to assess the learner’s current level of verbal behavior.

In the early stages, language is primarily used to fulfill immediate needs, but as skills advance, learners may also use language to avoid or deflect demands—for example, by stating an excuse instead of engaging in a challenging task.

Recognizing these patterns allows us to tailor our interventions to promote functional communication and flexibility (Doe & Roe, 2019; Salmon et al., 2016).

## Stage 1: Basic Verbal Operants – From Physical Escape to Simple Requests
Overview:At this early stage, language appears as basic mands (requests), tacts (labels), echoics (imitation), and simple intraverbals (basic conversational exchanges).

Often, when confronted with a challenging situation, a child may display escape behaviors—such as tantrums or crying—instead of using words.

Our goal is to teach the child to request that a particular set of reinforcing contingencies be returned rather than attempting to escape or avoid the task.
Integrated Mand Training and Differential Reinforcement (DRA) Using a Shaping Approach:We begin by using a shaping process informed by Synthesized Behavior Treatment (SBT) principles.

In this process, any attempt by the child to verbally request the return of the desired reinforcer is reinforced.

Initially, even approximations—such as any vocalization directed toward obtaining the reinforcer—may receive reinforcement.

Gradually, only responses that more closely approximate the target phrase (e.g., “I want my [preferred reinforcer] back” or “I need my reinforcing items now”) are reinforced.

This shaping procedure naturally integrates differential reinforcement of alternative behavior (DRA) as part of skill-based training.

If escape or avoidance behaviors occur—for example, if the child resorts to a tantrum instead of making a request—the reinforcer is withheld.

In such cases, principles of Kind Extinction are applied: while the functional reinforcer (access to the tangible or return of the desired contingencies) is withheld, the practitioner provides compassionate feedback (e.g., “I know this is hard; I’m here for you”).

This integrated approach supports the gradual acquisition of appropriate verbal requests while reducing reliance on escape or avoidance.
Additionally, echoic and tact training is used to build foundational communication skills.

For example, when the child sees an object (such as a “dog”), the practitioner models the word and prompts the child to repeat it.

Reinforcing these behaviors helps the learner develop a robust vocabulary that later supports more complex verbal interactions.
Environmental supports like picture schedules and communication boards further prompt the learner to request the return of reinforcing contingencies rather than engaging in escape behaviors.

## Stage 2: Transitional Language – From Simple Requests to Verbal Avoidance
Overview:As language skills become more advanced, learners begin to use verbal behavior more flexibly.

However, during this transitional stage, some children may start using language to avoid challenging tasks.

Instead of engaging with the task, they might offer verbal excuses (e.g., “It’s too hard” or “I don’t know”), thus delaying the return of reinforcing contingencies.

Notably, escape and avoidance behaviors continue to be present in this stage, albeit in a more verbal form.
## Specific Interventions:
Script Training & Role-Play:Develop and rehearse specific verbal scripts that the child can use in challenging situations.

For example, a script might be, “I’m having trouble; can you help me so I can get my [preferred reinforcer] back?” Practicing these scripts through role-play in a controlled setting helps the learner internalize adaptive verbal responses and reduce avoidance.
Social Narratives:Use social narratives to describe common challenging situations and to model appropriate ways to request that reinforcing contingencies be returned.

This narrative approach helps reshape the learner’s expectations and reinforces adaptive communication patterns.
ACT-Based Techniques:Introduce simplified Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) exercises that encourage the learner to notice when they are about to use language for avoidance.

Brief mindfulness practices help the learner acknowledge discomfort without defaulting to an avoidance statement, thus guiding them to request the specific reinforcers needed.

## Stage 3: Advanced Verbal Behavior – From Rule-Governed Avoidance to Psychological Flexibility
Overview:At the advanced stage, language is highly sophisticated, but it can sometimes be misused to justify rigid avoidance.

For example, a child might engage in rule-based self-talk such as “I always fail at this,” which leads to persistent nonengagement with challenging tasks.

Escape and avoidance behaviors remain present, now manifesting as entrenched verbal rules that hinder adaptive performance.
## Specific Interventions:
ACT-Based Self-Talk Defusion Exercises:Use ACT techniques to help learners observe negative self-talk as transient thoughts rather than absolute truths.

For instance, if a learner states, “I always mess up,” they can be guided to notice the thought and then practice a defusion exercise—such as visualizing the thought drifting away on a cloud—thereby reducing its influence on behavior.
Mindfulness-Based Interventions:Incorporate regular mindfulness practices to build awareness of internal dialogue.

By observing their thoughts and feelings without judgment, learners can interrupt rigid avoidance patterns and choose to engage with challenges despite discomfort.
Integrated Cognitive Flexibility Training:Combining ACT and mindfulness techniques enhances cognitive flexibility.

Structured exercises help the learner identify when they are relying on inflexible verbal rules and encourage them to adopt more adaptive, varied responses in the face of challenging tasks.

## Bringing It All Together
A functional approach to language intervention requires that our strategies match the learner’s developmental stage.

In Stage 1, we build foundational communication skills through mand training combined with DRA—using a shaping process informed by SBT principles and integrated with Kind Extinction—to encourage functional verbal requests while reducing escape and avoidance behaviors.

In Stage 2, script training, social narratives, and ACT-based techniques help transition the learner away from verbal avoidance toward adaptive communication.

Finally, in Stage 3, mindfulness and ACT-based self-talk defusion strategies foster cognitive flexibility, mitigating the influence of rigid verbal rules that maintain avoidance.
By aligning our intervention strategies with the learner’s current stage of verbal behavior—and integrating innovative, compassionate extensions throughout—we support not only effective communication but also the long-term emotional and behavioral well-being of our learners.
