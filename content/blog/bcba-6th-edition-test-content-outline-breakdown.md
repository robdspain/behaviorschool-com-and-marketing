## What Changed from the 5th Edition Task List?

The BACB retired the 5th Edition Task List when they released the 6th Edition Test Content Outline (TCO) — which became the basis for all BCBA exams beginning in 2025. Here's what's different:

- **Domains reorganized:** The 5th edition had 5 content areas (A–E). The 6th edition has 9 domains (A–I), creating a more granular structure.
- **Cultural responsiveness added:** Domain I is entirely new — it explicitly tests competencies around diversity, equity, and inclusion in behavior analysis practice.
- **Ethics integrated:** Rather than a standalone section, ethics is woven throughout and also has its own domain (E).
- **"Foundational" vs. "Applied" structure:** The 6th edition distinguishes between conceptual foundations (early domains) and applied practice (later domains).
- **Increased real-world scenarios:** Questions are more applied and scenario-based rather than definition-heavy.

> For a detailed comparison of 5th vs. 6th edition structure, see the BACB's published TCO at bacb.com.

## The 9 Domains of the BCBA 6th Edition TCO

The BACB does not publish exact question-by-question percentages for each domain publicly, but based on the task distribution (104 tasks across 9 domains) and candidate reports, the following represents the domain structure and relative weight on the exam.

---

### Domain A: Behaviorism and Philosophical Foundations
**Task count:** ~8 tasks | **Exam weight:** ~8–10%

This domain covers the philosophical and theoretical bedrock of behavior analysis — the "why" behind the science.

**Key tasks include:**
- Identify the goals of behavior analysis as a science (description, prediction, control)
- Explain the assumptions of behavior analysis (determinism, empiricism, parsimony, philosophical doubt)
- Distinguish between mentalistic and behavioral explanations of behavior
- Identify and explain the core principles of radical behaviorism
- Differentiate between respondent and operant conditioning

**School BCBA angle:** When writing behavioral definitions in IEPs or FBAs, this domain reminds you why observable/measurable behavior is required — not "bad attitude" or "ADHD moment."

---

### Domain B: Concepts and Principles
**Task count:** ~10 tasks | **Exam weight:** ~10–12%

The largest conceptual domain — this is where reinforcement, punishment, extinction, and related principles live.

**Key tasks include:**
- Define and provide examples of positive and negative reinforcement
- Distinguish among positive punishment, negative punishment, and extinction
- Define unconditioned and conditioned reinforcers/punishers
- Explain stimulus control and discrimination
- Define schedules of reinforcement and their behavioral effects
- Explain behavioral momentum and resurgence

**High-yield:** Schedules of reinforcement (VI, VR, FI, FR) and their characteristic response patterns come up consistently in candidate reports. Know the scallop pattern, the post-reinforcement pause, and which schedules are most resistant to extinction.

---

### Domain C: Measurement
**Task count:** ~11 tasks | **Exam weight:** ~10–12%

Measurement is one of the most applied domains and often underestimated by candidates. This is where data systems live.

**Key tasks include:**
- Define and distinguish among frequency, rate, duration, latency, interresponse time (IRT), and percent occurrence
- Select and implement appropriate measurement procedures based on the target behavior
- Evaluate the quality of behavioral data (accuracy, reliability, validity)
- Calculate and interpret IOA (interobserver agreement)
- Define and use continuous vs. discontinuous measurement

**School BCBA angle:** Data sheets, ABC recording, scatter plots, frequency counts for IEP goals — all of this anchors in Domain C. If you're building your exam prep, measurement should be a priority; it's both testable and immediately applicable.

---

### Domain D: Experimental Design
**Task count:** ~6 tasks | **Exam weight:** ~5–7%

Lighter on exam weight but requires conceptual precision. This covers single-case design, internal validity, and research interpretation.

**Key tasks include:**
- Distinguish between internal and external validity threats
- Identify and explain single-subject research designs (reversal/ABAB, multiple baseline, alternating treatments, changing criterion)
- Evaluate the appropriate use of each design type
- Interpret graphed data from single-case studies

**What to know:** The exam rarely asks you to design a study from scratch. Expect scenario questions: "A researcher wants to minimize carryover effects — which design is most appropriate?"

---

### Domain E: Ethics
**Task count:** ~11 tasks | **Exam weight:** ~12–15%

Ethics is the second-largest domain by task count and has become increasingly weighted. Do not underweight this.

**Key tasks include:**
- Apply the BACB Ethics Code in scenarios involving dual relationships, conflicts of interest, and boundary violations
- Identify scope-of-practice boundaries for BCBAs
- Apply requirements for supervisory relationships and documentation
- Identify ethical obligations around documentation, record-keeping, and data privacy
- Apply the decision-making framework for ethical dilemmas

**Top traps:**
- Dual relationships: the Code doesn't say "never" — it says avoid when harmful or exploitative
- Confidentiality and mandated reporting: know when you must disclose
- Supervisory ethics: what documentation is required, how supervision must be structured

---

### Domain F: Behavior Assessment
**Task count:** ~10 tasks | **Exam weight:** ~10–11%

This is where FBAs, preference assessments, and skill assessments live. Extremely applied, high relevance for school BCBAs.

**Key tasks include:**
- Conduct indirect and descriptive FBA methods (interviews, scatter plots, ABC data)
- Design and conduct functional analyses (analog, naturalistic, brief)
- Select, administer, and interpret preference assessments (MSWO, paired stimulus, free operant)
- Conduct skill assessments (VB-MAPP, AFLS, ABLLS)
- Interpret assessment results to guide intervention

**School BCBA angle:** The FBA → function → BIP chain is your daily workflow. This domain directly transfers to practice. If you're a working school BCBA, you have an advantage here — use it.

---

### Domain G: Behavior-Change Procedures
**Task count:** ~22 tasks | **Exam weight:** ~20–25%

The largest domain by task count. This is the "what do you do about it" domain — the heart of applied behavior analysis practice.

**Key tasks include:**
- Implement reinforcement-based interventions (DRI, DRO, DRA, DRL)
- Use extinction appropriately, including managing extinction bursts
- Apply punishment procedures (Type I and Type II) within ethical guidelines
- Implement antecedent modifications (prompting, prompt fading, chaining, shaping)
- Apply stimulus control procedures
- Use self-management and self-monitoring strategies
- Implement generalization and maintenance procedures
- Apply Behavioral Skills Training (BST)
- Implement discrete trial training (DTT) and naturalistic teaching strategies
- Use functional communication training (FCT)

**Study strategy:** This domain has the most tasks and typically the most exam questions. Learn procedures within the function-based framework. "The behavior serves escape — which procedure directly addresses that?" Practice linking function → intervention choice.

**High-yield for school BCBAs:** FCT, DRA/DRI for function-based intervention, prompt hierarchies, and generalization programming.

---

### Domain H: Selecting and Implementing Interventions
**Task count:** ~9 tasks | **Exam weight:** ~8–10%

This domain bridges assessment to practice — how you select, plan, and implement behavior support.

**Key tasks include:**
- Prioritize target behaviors based on social significance and client needs
- Develop measurable behavior-change goals
- Adapt interventions to client characteristics and contextual variables
- Collaborate with stakeholders (families, teachers, school teams)
- Evaluate intervention effectiveness and make data-based decisions

**School BCBA angle:** Collaborating with teachers, adapting for classroom contexts, and fitting behavior support into MTSS/PBIS tiers — this domain is your daily work. Candidates with school experience often find this domain intuitive.

---

### Domain I: Personnel Supervision and Management
**Task count:** ~7 tasks | **Exam weight:** ~7–9%

Added emphasis in the 6th edition. This domain covers how BCBAs train, supervise, and support RBTs and other behavior technicians.

**Key tasks include:**
- Apply BACB supervisory requirements and documentation standards
- Use Behavioral Skills Training (BST) to train supervisees
- Provide performance feedback and monitor supervisee performance
- Design and implement staff training programs
- Monitor and support RBT competency

**What to know:** BST (instruction + modeling + rehearsal + feedback) appears across both Domain G and Domain I — know it inside and out. Also know the BACB's requirements for supervision documentation.

## Which Domains Should You Study First?

**Tier 1 — Study these first (highest yield):**
- Domain G (Behavior-Change Procedures) — 20–25% of the exam
- Domain E (Ethics) — 12–15% and notorious for tricky scenarios
- Domain C (Measurement) — math-based, requires practice

**Tier 2 — High importance, study concurrently:**
- Domain B (Concepts and Principles) — foundational, high application
- Domain F (Behavior Assessment) — very applied, FBA/FA questions
- Domain H (Selecting and Implementing Interventions) — applied decision-making

**Tier 3 — Don't skip, but proportional study:**
- Domain A (Behaviorism) — conceptual, sets the frame
- Domain I (Supervision) — growing emphasis in the 6th edition
- Domain D (Experimental Design) — lower weight, but precision matters

---

## What This Means for School-Based BCBAs

If you work in schools, you have an advantage on the BCBA exam — and some blind spots.

**Advantages:**
- Domain F and Domain H mirror school-based practice
- Domain G's function-based procedures (FBA → FCT → DRA) are your daily workflow
- You see IEP goal development, team collaboration, and MTSS tiers in real life

**Potential blind spots:**
- Domain D (Experimental Design): school BCBAs rarely conduct single-subject research
- Domain E (Ethics): school settings create unique dual relationship and confidentiality challenges
- Domain B (Schedules of reinforcement): classroom practice is rarely as precise as the exam requires

## How to Use This Breakdown in Your Study Plan

1. **Map your current knowledge to each domain.** Take a diagnostic practice exam and score yourself by domain. [Try our free BCBA practice exam](https://study.behaviorschool.com) — it tracks your performance by domain automatically.
2. **Allocate study time by weight.** Domain G deserves roughly 2.5x the study time of Domain D.
3. **Study the Ethics Code directly.** Don't rely on summaries — read the 2022 BACB Ethics Code. It's 30 pages and entirely testable.
4. **Practice IOA calculations.** Measurement (Domain C) has math questions. Do them with paper before exam day.
5. **Do domain-specific practice questions.** After studying each domain, hit practice questions targeting it specifically.
