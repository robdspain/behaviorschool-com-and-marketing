*Edited by Rob Spain, BCBA, IBA*

Traditional behavior support plans focus on observable behavior and function. That is necessary. But in schools, it is often not sufficient.

Students are dealing with anxiety, trauma, peer pressure, and avoidance. Staff are burned out and reactive. Teaching a replacement behavior is helpful, but if we ignore internal experiences like worry, frustration, or shame, we miss a huge part of the picture.

That is where Acceptance and Commitment Training (ACT) and Relational Frame Theory (RFT) can strengthen behavior support plans. ACT gives us tools for psychological flexibility, while RFT explains how language and cognition drive behavior.

This guide shows how to build ACT-informed behavior support plans for schools without abandoning the behavior-analytic foundation.

## Why ACT Belongs in School Behavior Plans

ACT is not therapy. It is a behavior analytic approach to language and cognition that helps students and staff respond to difficult thoughts and feelings without letting those experiences dictate behavior.

In school settings, ACT helps with:

- **Avoidance behavior** (work refusal, skipping class, elopement)
- **Anxiety-driven disruption** (outbursts when tasks feel overwhelming)
- **Rigid rule-following** ("If I fail, I am stupid" leading to shutdown)
- **Staff burnout** (reactive responses, low tolerance for behavior challenges)

ACT does not replace FBA or BIP. It complements them by addressing internal events that function as setting events or motivating operations.

## The ACT Hexaflex in School Language

ACT is built around six processes (the hexaflex). Here is how they translate into school-friendly language:

1. **Acceptance:** Making room for uncomfortable feelings ("I can feel nervous and still take the test")
2. **Cognitive defusion:** Not getting hooked by thoughts ("My brain is telling me I will fail, but that is just a thought")
3. **Present moment awareness:** Paying attention to what is happening now
4. **Self-as-context:** Seeing yourself as more than your thoughts or feelings
5. **Values:** Identifying what matters ("I want to be a good friend" or "I want to graduate")
6. **Committed action:** Taking steps aligned with values, even when it is hard

For students, this might look like teaching them to notice a thought like "I hate reading" and still try because they value learning or independence.

For staff, it might look like recognizing frustration during a behavior episode and still responding with calm, consistent strategies.

## How ACT Fits Into an FBA and BIP

You can integrate ACT into a behavior plan at three levels:

### 1. As a Setting Event Intervention

If a student has chronic anxiety or stress, ACT strategies can reduce the setting event that makes behavior worse.

**Example:**
- Student refuses tasks when they feel anxious about failure.
- ACT strategy: Teach acceptance of anxious feelings and use defusion to reduce avoidance.

### 2. As a Replacement Behavior

Instead of only teaching external behaviors (raise hand, ask for a break), teach internal coping responses:

- "Name the feeling"
- "Notice the thought"
- "Take one breath and choose the next action"

These can be taught like any other skill, with modeling and reinforcement.

### 3. As a Staff Response Plan

Staff reactions are part of the consequence environment. ACT can improve staff responses by increasing psychological flexibility.

**Example:**
- Staff notices frustration rising during a student's escalation
- Staff uses an ACT strategy: "Name the feeling, take one breath, choose the response aligned with student safety and dignity"

This reduces reactive or punitive responses that often reinforce problem behavior.

## ACT-Based Behavior Support Plan Framework

Here is a practical framework you can use in schools:

### Step 1: Conduct a Standard FBA

Do not skip the basics. You still need:
- Clear behavior definitions
- Antecedents and consequences
- A hypothesis about function

Use the [FBA-to-BIP tool](/fba-to-bip) if you want to streamline the report and ensure legal defensibility.

### Step 2: Identify Internal Barriers

Ask: What internal events are contributing to the behavior?

Common internal barriers:
- Fear of failure
- Shame after repeated corrections
- Anxiety about peers
- Trauma-related hypervigilance
- Rigid rules ("If I am not first, I am last")

Gather information from student interviews, teacher input, and observation.

### Step 3: Clarify Student Values

Values are a powerful motivator for behavior change. Ask the student:

- What kind of student do you want to be?
- What kind of friend do you want to be?
- What matters to you at school?

You can turn values into simple, age-appropriate statements:

- "I want to be a helper in class"
- "I want to stay out of trouble"
- "I want to play on the soccer team"

Values give meaning to replacement behaviors.

### Step 4: Teach ACT Skills as Replacement Behaviors

Teach one or two skills aligned with the student's needs:

**Acceptance skill:**
- "Notice the feeling" routine
- Practice sitting with discomfort for 10-30 seconds

**Defusion skill:**
- "I am having the thought that..." script
- Silly voice exercise (say the negative thought in a cartoon voice)

**Present moment skill:**
- 5-4-3-2-1 sensory grounding
- Simple breathing routine

**Committed action skill:**
- "Even though I feel ___, I will ___ because I value ___"

### Step 5: Integrate Into the BIP

Add ACT skills to the teaching section of the BIP:

- **Replacement behavior:** Student uses a break card AND uses a 10-second breathing routine before returning to task
- **Reinforcement:** Praise and points for using the ACT skill (not just compliance)

### Step 6: Train Staff

Staff need simple scripts and visuals. Keep it practical:

- "I see this is hard. Take one breath, then we will start together."
- "Your mind is telling you you cannot do it. That is a thought. You can still take one step."

### Step 7: Monitor Progress

Track both external behavior and ACT skill use:

- Frequency of problem behavior
- Frequency of replacement behavior
- Frequency of ACT skill use (self-report or staff observation)
- Student self-rating of stress (1-5 scale)

## Example ACT-Based Behavior Plan (Middle School)

**Student:** 7th grader with chronic task refusal in math

**FBA Summary:**
- Behavior: Refuses math tasks, puts head down, leaves seat
- Function: Escape from difficult tasks
- Setting event: Anxiety about failing, history of low grades

**ACT Integration:**

- **Values statement:** "I want to pass math so I can graduate and play sports"
- **Acceptance skill:** 10-second breathing routine when feeling anxious
- **Defusion skill:** "I am having the thought that I cannot do this"
- **Replacement behavior:** Use help card after attempting 3 problems

**BIP Strategies:**

- Prevention: Provide choice of problem order, shorten tasks, pre-teach key concepts
- Teaching: Practice the ACT routine during calm times
- Consequence: Immediate praise and points for using ACT skill and attempting work

**Progress monitoring:**
- Task completion rate
- Frequency of ACT skill use
- Teacher rating of engagement

**Outcome:** After 6 weeks, refusal episodes dropped by 60%, and the student completed 70% of assignments.

## ACT and RFT Considerations for School BCBAs

RFT reminds us that language is learned behavior. Students can become "stuck" in relational frames that are not helpful, such as:

- "If I fail, I am a failure"
- "If I ask for help, I am weak"
- "If I am corrected, I am bad"

ACT helps students defuse from these rules and choose behavior based on values rather than rigid self-rules.

This aligns with the BACB Ethics Code, which emphasizes client dignity, respect, and evidence-based practice. ACT is supported by a growing body of research and can be ethically integrated into school-based ABA when used within our scope of competence.

## FERPA and School-Based ACT Work

Any ACT-based intervention still involves student data. Keep all notes, reflections, and monitoring data in FERPA-compliant systems. Do not store student reflections in unsecured apps or general AI tools.

## Tools That Support ACT-Based Plans

The [BehaviorSchool ACT Tools](/act-tools) provide school-friendly exercises, visuals, and scripts aligned with the ACT hexaflex. Use them to teach acceptance, defusion, and values work in a way that fits classroom settings.

For the full behavior plan, use the [Behavior Plans tool](/behavior-plans) or the [FBA-to-BIP tool](/fba-to-bip) to keep documentation aligned with IDEA and your district requirements.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is ACT appropriate for elementary students?

Yes, with adaptations. Use simple language, visuals, and short exercises. "Notice the feeling" or "take one breath" can be taught to young students without complex metaphors.

### Do I need to be a licensed therapist to use ACT in a BIP?

No. ACT is a behavioral approach that can be used within the scope of ABA. Focus on teaching observable skills (acceptance, defusion) as behavior strategies, not therapy. Stay within your scope of competence.

### How do I explain ACT to teachers?

Keep it practical. "We are teaching the student to notice big feelings and still take the next step." Provide simple scripts and visuals so teachers can use it without extra training.

### Will ACT replace reinforcement and traditional behavior strategies?

No. ACT is additive. You still use reinforcement, antecedent strategies, and function-based consequences. ACT helps students handle internal barriers so those strategies can work.

### How do I measure ACT skill use?

Use simple checklists: Did the student use the breathing routine? Did they use the "I am having the thought" script? Pair this with data on the target behavior to see if the ACT skills are helping.
