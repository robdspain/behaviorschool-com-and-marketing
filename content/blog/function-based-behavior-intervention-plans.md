*AI-assisted draft; reviewed and edited by Rob Spain.*

Here's a hard truth about behavior intervention plans: most of them don't work. Not because behavior intervention is ineffective — decades of research prove otherwise — but because most BIPs aren't actually function-based. They're lists of generic strategies ("give the student breaks," "use positive reinforcement," "provide choices") that aren't connected to *why* the behavior is happening.

A function-based BIP is different. Every component — every antecedent modification, every replacement behavior, every consequence strategy — is directly linked to the function identified in the FBA. That's what makes it effective, and that's what this guide will teach you to build.

## What Makes a BIP "Function-Based"?

A behavior intervention plan is function-based when:

1. **It's built on FBA data.** Not assumptions, not gut feelings — actual assessment data that identifies the function of the target behavior.
2. **The replacement behavior serves the same function.** If the student is hitting to escape work, the replacement must also let them escape (appropriately).
3. **Antecedent strategies address identified triggers.** Not generic modifications, but specific changes to the conditions that reliably predict the problem behavior.
4. **Consequence strategies are function-aligned.** Reinforcement is delivered for the replacement behavior in a way that makes it more efficient than the problem behavior.

### Why Generic BIPs Fail

Consider this common scenario: A student throws materials when given math assignments. A generic BIP might include:

- "Provide choices"
- "Use positive reinforcement"
- "Allow breaks"
- "Implement a token economy"

These strategies *might* help, but without knowing the function, you're guessing. If the behavior functions to escape math (because it's too difficult), then "provide choices" between two equally difficult math tasks won't help. But if it functions to get peer attention, "allow breaks" might actually *reinforce* the throwing by giving the student what they want.

A function-based BIP eliminates the guesswork.

## The Four Functions of Behavior

Every BIP should map to one or more of these functions:

### 1. Escape/Avoidance
The behavior allows the student to get away from something aversive — a difficult task, a non-preferred activity, a social situation, or sensory input.

**Signs it's escape:**
- Behavior occurs when demands are placed
- Behavior stops when the demand is removed
- Behavior is more likely during non-preferred activities
- Behavior is less likely during preferred activities

### 2. Attention
The behavior produces social responses from others — teacher attention, peer reactions, even negative attention like reprimands.

**Signs it's attention:**
- Behavior occurs when the student is not receiving attention
- Behavior stops (or escalates) when attention is given
- Student looks at others during or after the behavior
- Behavior occurs more with certain people present

### 3. Access to Tangibles/Activities
The behavior results in the student getting something they want — a toy, a device, an activity, food, or a turn.

**Signs it's access:**
- Behavior occurs when a preferred item is visible but unavailable
- Behavior occurs when told "no" or "wait"
- Behavior stops when the item/activity is provided

### 4. Automatic/Sensory
The behavior itself produces reinforcement — sensory stimulation, pain reduction, or internal satisfaction — independent of social consequences.

**Signs it's automatic:**
- Behavior occurs across all settings and contexts
- Behavior occurs when the student is alone
- Behavior has a stereotyped, repetitive quality
- Social consequences don't seem to affect the behavior

## Building a Function-Based BIP: Step by Step

### Step 1: Start with the FBA Hypothesis

Your BIP should directly reference the FBA hypothesis statement. If you don't have one, stop — go back and complete the FBA first. A BIP without an FBA is like a prescription without a diagnosis.

**Example hypothesis:** "When presented with independent writing tasks that require more than 3 sentences, Jayden engages in verbal refusal ('I can't,' 'This is stupid') and puts his head on his desk to escape the academic demand. This behavior is more likely on Mondays and days following absences."

Everything in the BIP flows from this statement.

### Step 2: Design Antecedent Strategies

Antecedent strategies modify the environment *before* the problem behavior occurs. They're your first line of defense and often the most impactful component.

**For escape-maintained behavior:**
- Modify task difficulty (scaffolding, chunking, reducing response effort)
- Provide choice in task format (not whether to do work, but how)
- Prime the student before transitions or demands
- Address setting events (Monday check-in routine, post-absence reintegration plan)
- Use high-probability request sequences (easy tasks before hard ones)
- Embed preferred activities within non-preferred ones

**For attention-maintained behavior:**
- Provide frequent, scheduled attention (non-contingent reinforcement)
- Give attention before the student seeks it inappropriately
- Increase opportunities for positive attention (classroom jobs, leadership roles)
- Pre-teach expected behaviors and acknowledge them immediately

**For access-maintained behavior:**
- Provide scheduled access to preferred items/activities
- Use visual schedules so the student knows when they'll get access
- Offer choices between acceptable options
- Pre-teach waiting and accepting "no"

**For automatically-maintained behavior:**
- Provide appropriate sensory alternatives (matched stimulation)
- Modify the environment to reduce triggers (noise-canceling headphones, flexible seating)
- Build movement breaks into the schedule
- Provide access to sensory tools proactively

### Step 3: Select and Teach Replacement Behaviors

The replacement behavior is the linchpin of a function-based BIP. It must:

1. **Serve the same function** as the problem behavior
2. **Be more efficient** — easier, faster, and more reliably reinforced
3. **Be socially appropriate**
4. **Be within the student's current repertoire** (or teachable quickly)

#### Replacement Behaviors by Function

**Escape:**
- Requesting a break (verbally, with a card, or gesturally)
- Asking for help
- Requesting a modified task
- Using a self-monitoring system to pace work

**Attention:**
- Raising hand
- Using a "talk to me" signal
- Appropriately joining conversations
- Showing work to the teacher for feedback

**Access:**
- Requesting items/activities appropriately
- Using a visual schedule to check when access is available
- Trading or negotiating with peers
- Using a token system to earn access

**Automatic:**
- Using an appropriate sensory alternative
- Requesting a sensory break
- Self-monitoring and redirecting

### Teaching the Replacement Behavior

Don't assume the student knows how to perform the replacement behavior. Explicitly teach it:

1. **Explain** why they're learning this skill and how it helps them
2. **Model** the behavior in the natural context
3. **Practice** during calm moments, not during a behavioral incident
4. **Prompt** the replacement behavior when antecedents occur (then fade prompts)
5. **Reinforce** immediately and consistently when the student uses it

### Step 4: Modify Consequence Strategies

Consequence strategies ensure that the replacement behavior is more effective than the problem behavior.

**Reinforce the replacement behavior:**
- Immediately (especially at first)
- Consistently (every time, at first)
- With the functional reinforcer (if the function is escape, the reinforcer is a break — not a sticker)

**Respond to the problem behavior:**
- Don't provide the functional reinforcer (extinction)
- Redirect to the replacement behavior
- Keep your response brief and neutral (no lectures, no emotional reactions)
- Implement safety procedures if needed

**Important:** Extinction can produce an extinction burst (temporary increase in behavior intensity). Warn the team and have a plan for it.

#### The Efficiency Formula

For a replacement behavior to "win" over the problem behavior, it needs to beat it on at least one of these dimensions:

| Dimension | Problem Behavior | Replacement Behavior (Goal) |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **Physical effort** | Low (just needs to throw materials) | Lower (just raise a card) |
| **Time to reinforcement** | Fast (task removed immediately) | Faster (break granted immediately when card is raised) |
| **Consistency** | Sometimes works | Always works (at first) |
| **Quality of reinforcer** | Full escape (sent to office) | Adequate (2-minute break at desk) |

### Step 5: Plan for Generalization and Fading

A BIP that works only with one adult in one classroom isn't really working. Build in:

- **Generalization:** Train across settings, staff, and times of day
- **Fading:** Gradually increase expectations (shorter breaks, more work before a break, less frequent prompts)
- **Maintenance:** Check in periodically to ensure the behavior change is sustained

### Step 6: Create a Data Collection Plan

Your BIP should specify:

- **What data to collect** — frequency of problem behavior AND replacement behavior
- **Who collects it** — the classroom teacher, a paraprofessional, the student themselves
- **When to collect** — specific times/activities or all day
- **How to record it** — tally sheet, interval recording, daily rating, app
- **When to review** — weekly team check-ins, monthly data review

Keep it simple. The best data system is the one that actually gets used.

## Function-Based BIP Template

Here's a complete template you can adapt:

- Function identified in FBA

### Section 3: Hypothesis Statement
- Direct from the FBA report

### Section 4: Prevention Strategies (Antecedents)
- Setting event strategies
- Immediate antecedent modifications
- Environmental arrangements

### Section 5: Replacement Behavior
- Operational definition of replacement behavior
- How it serves the same function
- Teaching plan (who, when, how)

### Section 6: Consequence Strategies
- How to reinforce the replacement behavior
- How to respond to the problem behavior
- Extinction procedures (if applicable)
- Safety/crisis protocol (if needed)

### Section 7: Data Collection Plan
- What, who, when, how
- Decision rules (when to modify the plan)

### Section 8: Team Communication Plan
- How often the team meets to review data
- Who is responsible for what
- How to handle questions or concerns

## Common BIP Mistakes

### 1. The "Bribery" BIP
Offering rewards for *not* engaging in problem behavior without teaching a replacement. "If you don't hit anyone today, you get extra recess." This doesn't teach what TO do and often falls apart quickly.

### 2. The Punishment-Heavy BIP
Focused entirely on consequences for problem behavior (loss of privileges, calls home, office referrals) with no antecedent modifications or replacement behavior teaching. Punishment alone doesn't teach new skills.

### 3. The Kitchen Sink BIP
Listing every possible strategy without connecting them to function. "Provide visual schedule, token economy, social stories, fidget tools, brain breaks, mindfulness, peer buddy, check-in/check-out." If you can't explain why each strategy addresses the identified function, it doesn't belong.

### 4. The Unrealistic BIP
Requiring the classroom teacher to collect continuous ABC data on 5 behaviors while teaching 28 students. If staff can't implement it, it won't work — no matter how well-designed it is on paper.

### 5. The Static BIP
Writing the plan and never revising it. BIPs should be living documents that evolve based on data.

## Streamline Your BIP Process

Building a function-based BIP from scratch is time-intensive. BehaviorSchool's [FBA-to-BIP Generator](/fba-to-bip) takes your FBA findings — the target behavior, identified function, antecedent triggers, and setting events — and generates a complete, function-based behavior intervention plan with:

- Antecedent strategies matched to the function
- Replacement behaviors with teaching plans
- Consequence strategies aligned with the hypothesis
- Data collection recommendations
- A format ready for IEP team review

It doesn't replace your professional judgment — it gives you a strong, function-aligned draft that you can customize for the individual student.

Pair it with the [IEP Goal Writer](/iep-goal-writer) to generate measurable behavior goals that align with your BIP, and you've got a complete package from assessment to intervention to IEP documentation.

## Conclusion

A function-based BIP is the difference between managing behavior and changing it. When every component of your plan connects back to why the behavior is happening, you're not just putting out fires — you're addressing root causes and teaching students skills they'll use for life.

Start with a solid FBA. Build your BIP around the function. Teach a replacement behavior that works better than the problem behavior. Collect data. Adjust. Repeat.

That's effective behavior intervention. And it's what school-based BCBAs do better than anyone.
