*Edited by Rob Spain, BCBA, IBA*

Year 1 as a school BCBA is hard, but it is also exciting. You are learning, building your caseload, figuring out the systems. You are tired, but you are motivated.

Year 2 hits differently. The novelty is gone. Your caseload has doubled. The paperwork never stops. You have been working nights and weekends for months, and you are starting to wonder if this is sustainable.

Year 3 is the breaking point. This is when most school BCBAs either leave for clinic jobs, quit ABA entirely, or find a way to fundamentally restructure how they work.

This post is about why years 2-3 are the burnout cliff, what invisible work is draining you, and how to survive without sacrificing your mental health or your career.

## The Year 2-3 Burnout Cliff: Why It Happens

### Year 1: The Honeymoon

In your first year, you are still learning the ropes:

- Caseload is building gradually (maybe 10-15 students by spring)
- Administrators give you some grace as the "new BCBA"
- Everything is a learning experience, so frustrations feel temporary
- You have not yet hit IEP season with a full caseload

You are tired, but it is survivable.

### Year 2: The Reality Check

By your second year, several things change:

- **Your caseload is now 25-40 students** (or more in some districts)
- **You own the entire FBA/BIP process** (no one is checking your work or guiding you)
- **IEP season is relentless** (3-5 meetings per week, every week from October to November and February to March)
- **Crisis calls pull you from planned work constantly**
- **You are supervising RBTs or grad students** (adding supervision hours on top of everything else)
- **The invisible work becomes visible:** mileage tracking, scheduling, supply ordering, emails, data entry

You are working 50-60 hour weeks, and you are falling behind.

### Year 3: The Breaking Point

By year 3, one of three things happens:

1. **You leave for a clinic job** (better pay, more support, no IEP meetings, less travel)
2. **You quit ABA entirely** (burnout is complete, you switch careers)
3. **You figure out how to work smarter** (set boundaries, automate, delegate, or reduce caseload)

Most school BCBAs who survive past year 3 had to make significant changes to how they work. The ones who did not are gone.

## The Invisible Work That Is Killing You

The hardest part of school BCBA burnout is that the work no one sees is often the work that takes the most time.

### 1. Scheduling and Coordination

Scheduling an FBA observation requires:

- Checking your calendar
- Checking the teacher's schedule
- Checking when the behavior is most likely to occur
- Confirming the student will be at school that day
- Emailing the teacher, the site secretary, and sometimes the principal
- Driving to the site (20-45 minutes each way)

For one observation, you have spent 2-3 hours when you include drive time and coordination. Multiply that by 30 students.

### 2. Mileage and Reimbursement Tracking

You drive 300-500 miles per week across 4-8 school sites. Tracking mileage for reimbursement is tedious, but if you do not do it, you lose hundreds of dollars per month.

### 3. Email and Communication Overload

You get 50-100 emails per day:

- Teachers asking for help
- Parents requesting meetings
- Administrators forwarding behavior incidents
- IEP coordinators scheduling meetings
- Vendors selling you stuff you do not need

Responding to emails takes 1-2 hours per day. Not responding makes you look unresponsive.

### 4. Data Entry and Graphing

You collect data during observations. Then you have to enter it into a spreadsheet, graph it, and prepare it for IEP meetings. For 30 students, this is 10+ hours per month.

### 5. Professional Development and CEUs

You need 32 CEU hours per 2-year cycle. Conferences are expensive and hard to get approval for. Online courses are cheaper but you have to do them on your own time. Either way, it is more hours.

### 6. Supervision Documentation

If you supervise RBTs or grad students, you need to document every supervision contact: date, time, what was covered, signatures. This is 2-4 hours per month just on paperwork.

### 7. Supply Management

You need reinforcers, data sheets, timers, fidgets, visual supports. Ordering supplies, tracking what you have, restocking your car. No one budgets time for this, but it takes hours every month.

## The Myth of the 40-Hour Work Week

Most school BCBA job descriptions say "40 hours per week, school calendar."

Here is what a realistic week actually looks like for a school BCBA with a caseload of 30 students:

| Task | Hours per Week |
|------|----------------|
| IEP meetings | 6-10 |
| FBA observations and data collection | 8-12 |
| Report writing (FBAs, BIPs, progress reports) | 10-15 |
| Teacher consultation and training | 4-6 |
| RBT/grad student supervision | 4-6 |
| Crisis response and behavioral emergencies | 2-5 |
| Email and communication | 5-8 |
| Drive time between sites | 6-10 |
| Data entry and graphing | 3-5 |
| Scheduling and coordination | 2-3 |
| Professional development | 1-2 |
| **Total** | **51-82 hours** |

Even on the low end, you are working 50+ hours per week. On the high end (IEP season, multiple crises), you are working 70-80 hours.

That is not sustainable.

## Why School Districts Do Not Understand Your Workload

The problem is that most administrators and special education directors have never been BCBAs. They do not understand that:

- **An FBA is not a 1-hour task.** It is 10-15 hours from referral to completed report.
- **A BIP is not a template.** It is a customized, legally defensible document that takes 4-6 hours to write well.
- **IEP meetings are not the only work.** The prep, follow-up, and documentation take twice as long as the meeting itself.
- **Crisis response is not billable.** You spend 3 hours de-escalating a student, but it does not count toward your caseload metrics.

They see your caseload of 30 students and think, "That is manageable." They do not see the invisible work.

## The Isolation Problem

School BCBAs are often the only BCBA in their district. That means:

- No one to consult with when you are stuck on a case
- No one who understands what you do
- No peer support when you are overwhelmed
- No one to cover for you when you are out sick

Clinic BCBAs have a team. School BCBAs are alone.

This isolation compounds burnout. You cannot vent to your administrator (they do not get it). You cannot vent to teachers (they are overwhelmed too). You feel like you are on an island.

## What Happens When You Burn Out

Burnout does not look the same for everyone, but common signs include:

- **Emotional exhaustion:** You dread going to work. You cry in your car between schools.
- **Depersonalization:** You stop caring about students. They become "cases" instead of kids.
- **Reduced personal accomplishment:** You feel like nothing you do makes a difference.
- **Physical symptoms:** Headaches, insomnia, stomach issues, getting sick frequently.
- **Avoidance:** You stop checking email. You cancel meetings. You call in sick more often.

If you are experiencing these, you are not weak. You are human. The system is broken.

## How to Survive (and Maybe Even Thrive)

Here are strategies that actually work for school BCBAs who made it past year 3:

### 1. Set Boundaries (and Defend Them)

**Stop working nights and weekends.** This is the hardest one, but it is the most important.

- No email after 5pm or on weekends (set an auto-responder if needed)
- No report writing at home (if it does not fit in your work hours, your caseload is too big)
- Use your sick days and personal days (they exist for a reason)

**Example boundary:** "I do not attend IEP meetings before 8:30am or after 3:30pm. If that does not work, we will find another date."

### 2. Reduce Your Caseload (or Redefine It)

If you have 40 students and you are drowning, something has to give.

**Options:**
- Negotiate a lower caseload with your administrator ("I can manage 25 students well or 40 students poorly")
- Transition some Tier 2 students back to school-based supports (not every student needs a BCBA)
- Advocate for hiring another BCBA to share the load

### 3. Automate and Streamline Documentation

Stop writing FBAs and BIPs from scratch every time.

**Use tools:**
- [BehaviorSchool FBA-to-BIP tool](/fba-to-bip) generates hypothesis-driven reports in minutes
- [BehaviorSchool IEP Goal Writer](/iep-goal-writer) creates measurable, function-based goals
- [Behavior Plans tool](/behavior-plans) for Tier 1 and Tier 2 interventions

If a tool saves you 8 hours per FBA and you do 3 FBAs per month, that is 24 hours back. That is three full workdays.

### 4. Batch Your Work

Stop bouncing between tasks. Batch similar work together:

- **Observation days:** Block Tuesdays and Thursdays for observations only. No meetings, no email.
- **Writing days:** Block Fridays for report writing only.
- **IEP days:** Accept IEP meetings only on Mondays and Wednesdays.

Batching reduces context-switching and makes you more efficient.

### 5. Delegate What You Can

You do not have to do everything yourself.

- Train teachers to collect baseline data (you review it, but they collect it)
- Have RBTs graph their own data (you review it during supervision)
- Use a site secretary to schedule meetings instead of doing it yourself

Delegation is not laziness. It is leadership.

### 6. Find Your People

Join communities where other school BCBAs gather:

- School-Based BCBAs Facebook group
- Reddit r/bcba (filter for school posts)
- Local BCBA meetups or study groups
- [BehaviorSchool community](/community) (school BCBA-specific)

Even virtual peer support reduces isolation. Knowing you are not the only one struggling makes a difference.

### 7. Advocate for Systemic Change

Your burnout is not your fault. It is a systems problem.

**Advocate for:**
- Smaller caseloads (BACB recommends 20-25 for school BCBAs)
- Administrative support (schedulers, data entry assistants)
- Professional development budgets (CEUs should not come out of your pocket)
- Mileage reimbursement at federal rate (not the district's lower rate)

Bring data to these conversations: "I worked 62 hours last week. Here is the breakdown. This is not sustainable."

### 8. Consider the BehaviorSchool Transformation Program

If you are in the burnout danger zone and need structured support, the [BehaviorSchool Transformation Program](/pro) is a 12-week cohort for school BCBAs that includes:

- Weekly group coaching and case consultation
- Access to all BehaviorSchool tools (FBA/BIP, IEP goals, behavior plans)
- Peer community of other school BCBAs
- Time management and boundary-setting frameworks

It is designed specifically for BCBAs in years 2-5 who are on the edge of leaving the field.

## When to Leave

Sometimes the healthiest choice is to leave.

**Consider leaving if:**
- Your district refuses to reduce your caseload despite advocacy
- You are experiencing serious physical or mental health symptoms
- You have tried multiple strategies and nothing changes
- You no longer find any fulfillment in the work

Leaving does not make you a failure. It makes you self-aware.

**Where school BCBAs go:**
- Clinic-based ABA (better pay, more support, but different challenges)
- Private practice (more control, but you run a business)
- BCBA training programs (teaching the next generation)
- Consulting (contract work, choose your caseload)
- Adjacent fields (special education, school psychology, occupational therapy)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I know if I am burned out or just having a bad week?

Burnout is chronic, not acute. A bad week is temporary and improves with rest. Burnout persists even after a vacation, involves emotional exhaustion and cynicism, and does not improve without systemic change.

### Is it normal to work 60 hours a week as a school BCBA?

It is common, but it is not normal or sustainable. If you are consistently working 60+ hours, your caseload is too large, or your systems are inefficient, or both. Something needs to change.

### Should I tell my supervisor I am burned out?

This depends on your relationship with your supervisor and their ability to help. If you have a supportive supervisor, yes. If your supervisor is part of the problem, focus on advocating for specific changes (caseload reduction, admin support) rather than labeling it as burnout.

### Can I take a leave of absence?

Many districts offer FMLA (Family and Medical Leave Act) for health reasons, including mental health. If you are experiencing burnout-related symptoms (anxiety, depression, insomnia), talk to your doctor. You may qualify for short-term disability or a medical leave.

### What if I love the work but hate the workload?

This is the most common scenario. You love helping kids and schools, but the volume is unsustainable. Focus on strategies to reduce workload (automation, delegation, boundaries) and advocate for systemic change. You do not have to leave the field; you have to restructure how you work within it.
