*Edited by Rob Spain, BCBA, IBA*

You send out a teacher input form for an FBA. What you get back is gold: detailed observations, clear antecedents, specific consequences, and thoughtful hypotheses about function.

Just kidding. What you actually get is: "He has anger issues" and "She refuses to do work."

The problem is not that teachers do not care. The problem is that most FBA input forms ask the wrong questions in the wrong way. Teachers are not trained in behavior analysis, and they are juggling 28 other students while filling out your form during their 22-minute lunch break.

This guide will show you how to design teacher input forms that actually generate useful FBA data without adding hours to your workload or theirs.

## Why Teacher Input Matters for FBAs

Teachers are your best source of information about:

- **Antecedents:** What happens right before the behavior
- **Patterns:** When and where the behavior occurs most
- **Consequences:** What typically follows the behavior
- **Interventions tried:** What has and has not worked in the past
- **Student strengths:** Reinforcers, preferred activities, and positive behaviors

A good FBA interview can cut your observation time in half because you know exactly when and where to observe. A bad one leaves you flying blind.

## The Problem with Most FBA Teacher Input Forms

Here is what does not work:

### 1. Open-Ended Questions Without Context

**Bad example:** "Describe the student's behavior."

**What you get:** "He is defiant and disruptive."

**Why it fails:** "Defiant" is not observable. "Disruptive" could mean 50 different things. You learn nothing.

### 2. Jargon and ABA Terms Teachers Do Not Know

**Bad example:** "What is the hypothesized function of the behavior?"

**What you get:** Blank stare or "I don't know."

**Why it fails:** Teachers are not trained in functional assessment. Asking them to identify function without guidance is unrealistic.

### 3. Forms That Take 45 Minutes to Complete

**Why it fails:** Teachers do not have 45 minutes. If your form is longer than 2 pages, it will sit on their desk for a week or get rushed through.

### 4. No Examples or Prompts

**Bad example:** "List antecedents."

**What you get:** Nothing, or "class time."

**Why it fails:** Without examples, teachers do not know what level of specificity you need.

## What Makes a Good Teacher Input Form

A well-designed FBA teacher input form is:

- **Short** (1-2 pages max, 10-15 minutes to complete)
- **Concrete** (uses observable terms, provides examples)
- **Guided** (multiple choice or rating scales where possible)
- **Function-focused** (questions are designed to point toward function without using jargon)
- **Respectful** of teacher time and expertise

## Essential Questions for Your FBA Teacher Input Form

Here are the key sections and example questions that actually work.

### Section 1: Basic Information

Keep this section short. You probably already have most of this from records.

- Student name, grade, teacher name, date
- Current classroom placement and support services (SDC, RSP, aide support, etc.)
- How long have you worked with this student?

### Section 2: Target Behavior (Observable Terms)

**Goal:** Get a clear, specific description you can actually observe and measure.

**Question format:**

> "What does the behavior look like? Check all that apply and add details:"
>
> - ☐ Verbal disruption (examples: calling out, talking to peers, making noises, yelling)
> - ☐ Physical aggression (examples: hitting, kicking, pushing, throwing objects at others)
> - ☐ Leaving assigned area (examples: leaving seat, leaving classroom, elopement)
> - ☐ Task refusal (examples: pushing materials away, saying "no," putting head down)
> - ☐ Property destruction (examples: ripping paper, breaking pencils, throwing materials)
> - ☐ Self-injury (examples: hitting self, head-banging, biting self)
> - ☐ Other: ___________
>
> "Describe what the student says or does during a typical incident:"

**Why it works:** Checklists are fast. Examples show teachers the level of specificity you need. The open-ended follow-up lets them add context.

### Section 3: Frequency and Intensity

**Goal:** Quantify how often and how severe the behavior is.

**Question format:**

> "How often does this behavior occur?"
>
> - ☐ Multiple times per hour
> - ☐ 1-3 times per day
> - ☐ 2-4 times per week
> - ☐ Less than once per week
>
> "How long does a typical incident last?"
>
> - ☐ Less than 1 minute
> - ☐ 1-5 minutes
> - ☐ 5-15 minutes
> - ☐ More than 15 minutes
>
> "On a scale of 1-5, how disruptive is this behavior to the student's learning?"
> (1 = minimal, 5 = completely prevents learning)
>
> "On a scale of 1-5, how disruptive is this behavior to other students' learning?"
> (1 = minimal, 5 = completely halts instruction)

**Why it works:** Rating scales are quick and give you baseline data for progress monitoring later.

### Section 4: Antecedents (What Happens Right Before)

**Goal:** Identify patterns and triggers without using the word "antecedent."

**Question format:**

> "When is the behavior most likely to happen? Check all that apply:"
>
> - ☐ During specific subjects (which ones? _________)
> - ☐ During independent work
> - ☐ During group work or partner activities
> - ☐ During transitions (between activities, classes, or locations)
> - ☐ During unstructured time (recess, lunch, free time)
> - ☐ When given a difficult or non-preferred task
> - ☐ When the student is asked to wait or denied access to something
> - ☐ When an adult corrects or redirects the student
> - ☐ When interacting with specific peers (who? _________)
> - ☐ After the student has been absent or had a break (weekends, holidays)
> - ☐ Later in the day (seems tired or overstimulated)
> - ☐ No clear pattern
>
> "Is there anything specific that seems to trigger the behavior?" (Examples: certain types of assignments, particular adults, loud noises, changes in schedule)

**Why it works:** The checklist covers the most common antecedents. Teachers can quickly identify patterns even if they have not been formally tracking.

### Section 5: Consequences (What Happens Right After)

**Goal:** Figure out what is maintaining the behavior (even if the teacher does not realize they are reinforcing it).

**Question format:**

> "What typically happens immediately after the behavior? Check all that apply:"
>
> - ☐ I redirect or correct the student verbally
> - ☐ I give the student a break or send them out of the room
> - ☐ I move the student to a different seat or area
> - ☐ The student is sent to the office
> - ☐ Peers react (laugh, get upset, pay attention to the student)
> - ☐ The task or demand is removed or modified
> - ☐ I ignore the behavior
> - ☐ The student gets access to something they wanted
> - ☐ Other: ___________
>
> "After the behavior, does the student usually:"
>
> - ☐ Calm down and return to the task
> - ☐ Escalate further
> - ☐ Refuse to engage for the rest of the period
> - ☐ Repeat the behavior within a few minutes

**Why it works:** Teachers can describe what they do without feeling judged. You get critical information about maintaining consequences.

### Section 6: Function Hypothesis (Teacher-Friendly)

**Goal:** Get the teacher's perspective on why the behavior is happening, without using the word "function."

**Question format:**

> "In your opinion, what does the student get or avoid by engaging in this behavior? Check the one that seems most likely:"
>
> - ☐ Gets my attention or help
> - ☐ Gets attention from peers (laughs, reactions)
> - ☐ Gets out of doing a task or assignment
> - ☐ Gets access to a preferred item or activity
> - ☐ Gets sensory input (the behavior itself feels good or is calming)
> - ☐ I'm not sure
>
> "What do you think the student is trying to communicate through this behavior?"

**Why it works:** This reframes "function" as "what the student gets or avoids," which is more intuitive. The follow-up question about communication often reveals excellent insights.

### Section 7: What Has Worked (and What Hasn't)

**Goal:** Avoid repeating failed interventions and identify existing reinforcers.

**Question format:**

> "What strategies have you tried? For each, indicate if it helped, made things worse, or had no effect:"
>
> | Strategy | Helped | No Effect | Made It Worse | Haven't Tried |
> |----------|--------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
> | Verbal reminders or redirection | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
> | Breaks or movement breaks | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
> | Preferred seating or location | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
> | Visual schedule or checklist | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
> | Reward chart or token system | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
> | Extra time or modified assignments | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
> | Peer buddy or partner | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
> | Ignoring the behavior | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
> | Consequences (loss of privileges, etc.) | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ | ☐ |
>
> "What motivates this student? (Activities, items, people, praise, etc.)"

**Why it works:** The table format is fast. You learn what has been tried and get reinforcer ideas in one question.

### Section 8: Student Strengths and Positive Behaviors

**Goal:** Balance the deficit focus and identify existing skills to build on.

**Question format:**

> "What does this student do well? When is the student successful?"
>
> "What are the student's interests, strengths, or preferred activities?"

**Why it works:** Ending on strengths leaves the teacher feeling more positive about the student and gives you information for building rapport and choosing reinforcers.

## How to Actually Get Teachers to Fill Out the Form

Even the best form is useless if it sits blank on a desk for three weeks. Here is how to maximize completion:

### 1. Give Them the Form in Person

Hand it to them during a brief meeting (5-10 minutes). Walk through the first section together. Teachers are far more likely to complete a form if they have already started it with you.

### 2. Offer to Interview Them Instead

Some teachers would rather talk than write. Offer to sit down for a 15-minute interview and fill out the form yourself based on their responses. You will get richer data and build rapport.

### 3. Set a Clear, Short Deadline

"Can you get this back to me by Friday?" is better than "whenever you have time." But make sure the deadline is realistic (at least 3-5 days).

### 4. Provide Context

Include a brief note: "I'm conducting an FBA for [Student]. Your input is critical to developing an effective plan. This should take about 10 minutes. Thank you!"

### 5. Follow Up

If you do not get it back by the deadline, check in gently. Teachers are busy and things get lost. A friendly reminder usually works.

## Adapting the Form for Different Staff

You may need input from multiple people: general ed teacher, special ed teacher, instructional aide, recess supervisor, or specials teachers (PE, art, music). Consider creating shorter, role-specific versions:

- **General ed teacher:** Full form
- **Instructional aide:** Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 (they see the behavior but may not have tried interventions independently)
- **Specials teachers or yard duty:** Sections 2, 3, 4, and 5 only (brief, focused on their setting)

## Red Flags in Teacher Input

Sometimes teacher responses reveal things you need to address before or during the FBA:

- **"The behavior happens all day, every day"** → May indicate the teacher is overwhelmed or the behavior is actually multiple different behaviors. Narrow the focus.
- **"Nothing works"** → May signal learned helplessness or inconsistent implementation. Plan to observe and coach.
- **Blaming language** ("He just wants attention" or "She's manipulative") → The teacher may need psychoeducation about behavioral function and how to respond effectively.
- **Consequence is always removal** ("I send him to the office") → Likely an escape function being reinforced. The BIP will need to address this.

## Turning Teacher Input Into Your FBA Hypothesis

Once you have the completed forms, look for patterns:

1. **What are the most common antecedents?** (This tells you when to observe.)
2. **What consistently follows the behavior?** (This points to maintaining consequences.)
3. **What does the teacher think the function is?** (They are often right, even if they do not use ABA language.)
4. **What interventions made it worse?** (These likely reinforced the behavior.)

Use this information to form your initial hypothesis, then validate it through direct observation and ABC data.

## Using BehaviorSchool to Streamline the Process

If you are conducting multiple FBAs per month, manually organizing teacher input forms, observation data, and interviews gets overwhelming fast.

The [BehaviorSchool FBA-to-BIP tool](/fba-to-bip) includes built-in teacher input templates, stores all your FBA data in one place, and uses your inputs to generate hypothesis-driven FBA reports and function-based BIPs. You spend less time formatting documents and more time doing the actual clinical work.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if the teacher says they do not have time to fill out the form?

Offer to do a 10-15 minute interview instead. Sit down with them (or call during their prep period) and fill out the form together based on their verbal responses. Most teachers find this easier and faster.

### Should I give the form to the parent too?

Yes, but adapt it. Parents see different contexts (home, community) and can provide information about sleep, diet, medications, and other setting events. Remove school-specific jargon and add questions about home routines and antecedents.

### What if different teachers give completely different answers?

This is common and valuable information. It tells you the behavior is context-specific. Observe in both settings to understand why the student behaves differently with different staff or in different environments.

### How many teachers should I interview for one FBA?

At minimum, the primary teacher and any staff who see the behavior regularly. For a student in general ed with push-in support, interview both the gen ed teacher and the special ed teacher. If the behavior happens at recess or lunch, include yard duty or lunch supervisors.

### Can I use the same form for all students?

Yes, a well-designed form is flexible enough for most behaviors. You may want slight variations for very young students (early elementary) vs. older students, but the core questions remain the same.
