*AI-assisted draft; reviewed and edited by Rob Spain.*

A functional behavior assessment (FBA) is one of the most powerful tools in a school-based BCBA's toolkit. When done well, an FBA doesn't just describe what a student is doing — it explains *why* they're doing it. That understanding is what separates effective behavior intervention plans from the kind that collect dust in a filing cabinet.

Whether you're new to school-based practice or looking to sharpen your process, this guide walks you through every step of writing a thorough, defensible FBA that leads directly to meaningful intervention.

## What Is a Functional Behavior Assessment?

A functional behavior assessment is a systematic process for identifying the variables that reliably predict and maintain problem behavior. In plain language: you're figuring out what triggers the behavior and what keeps it going.

Under IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act), an FBA is required when:

- A student's behavior impedes their learning or the learning of others
- A student with a disability faces a disciplinary change of placement
- The IEP team determines one is needed

But best practice says you shouldn't wait for a crisis. An FBA should be part of your standard process whenever behavioral concerns arise at Tier 2 or Tier 3.

### FBA vs. Informal Behavior Observations

It's worth distinguishing a full FBA from a quick classroom observation:

| Feature | Informal Observation | Functional Behavior Assessment |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Scope | Single snapshot | Multiple settings, sources, and methods |
| Data | Anecdotal notes | Systematic data collection (ABC, scatterplot, frequency) |
| Analysis | Descriptive | Identifies function of behavior |
| Outcome | General recommendations | Hypothesis-driven BIP |
| Legal standing | None | Required under IDEA for certain actions |

## Step 1: Define the Target Behavior

Before you can assess behavior, you need to define it in observable, measurable terms. This is where many FBAs fall apart — vague descriptions lead to unreliable data and weak interventions.

### How to Write a Good Operational Definition

A strong operational definition passes the "stranger test": could someone who has never met the student read your definition and accurately identify when the behavior is and isn't occurring?

**Weak definition:** "Johnny is disruptive."

**Strong definition:** "During independent work time, Johnny leaves his assigned seat without permission, walks to other students' desks, and makes comments unrelated to the academic task (e.g., jokes, noises, questions about recess) at a rate that interrupts instruction."

### Tips for Defining Behavior

- **Be specific.** Use action verbs (hits, leaves, calls out) rather than trait labels (aggressive, defiant, lazy)
- **Include examples and non-examples.** What counts? What doesn't?
- **Identify all target behaviors.** Students often display multiple behaviors that may serve different functions
- **Prioritize.** If there are multiple behaviors, rank them by severity, frequency, and impact on learning

## Step 2: Gather Indirect Assessment Data

Indirect assessment means collecting information from people who know the student — without directly observing the behavior yourself. This gives you context and history that observation alone can't provide.

### Key Indirect Methods

**Record Review**
- IEP and evaluation history
- Attendance records
- Discipline referrals (look for patterns in time, location, and staff involved)
- Previous FBAs or BIPs
- Medical records (with consent) — medications, diagnoses, sleep issues

**Teacher and Staff Interviews**
Use structured interview tools like the Functional Assessment Interview (FAI) or the Questions About Behavioral Function (QABF). Key questions include:

- When does the behavior typically occur? When does it *not* occur?
- What happens right before the behavior?
- What happens right after?
- Are there setting events (sleep, medication changes, family stressors) that make the behavior more likely?
- What has been tried before? What worked, even partially?

**Student Interview**
Don't skip this. Students — especially older ones — often have insight into their own behavior. Ask open-ended questions:

- "What's the hardest part of your day?"
- "When do you feel most frustrated at school?"
- "What helps you when you're having a tough time?"

**Parent/Caregiver Interview**
Parents provide critical information about setting events, sleep patterns, medication, and behavior at home. They also help you understand cultural context that should inform your intervention.

## Step 3: Conduct Direct Observation

Direct observation is the backbone of your FBA. You're collecting data in the natural environment to identify patterns.

### ABC Data Collection

Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence (ABC) recording is the gold standard for descriptive assessment. For each instance of the target behavior, document:

- **Antecedent:** What happened immediately before? (demand placed, transition, peer interaction, left alone)
- **Behavior:** What exactly did the student do?
- **Consequence:** What happened immediately after? (teacher attention, task removed, peer reaction, sent to office)

Aim for multiple observation sessions across different times, settings, and activities.

### Scatterplot Analysis

A scatterplot helps you identify temporal patterns. Use a grid with time intervals on one axis and days on the other. Mark when behavior occurs. You'll often discover that behavior clusters around specific times, subjects, or transitions.

### Frequency, Duration, and Latency

Depending on the behavior, you may also want to track:

- **Frequency:** How often does it occur per session/day?
- **Duration:** How long does each episode last?
- **Latency:** How quickly does behavior occur after a specific trigger?

### Observation Tips for School Settings

- Observe during both high-probability and low-probability times
- Use multiple observers when possible to check reliability
- Be as unobtrusive as possible — your presence changes behavior
- Don't just observe the target student; watch peer and teacher behavior too

## Step 4: Analyze the Data and Develop a Hypothesis

This is where the assessment becomes *functional*. You're looking across all your data sources to identify consistent patterns.

### Identifying the Function of Behavior

In applied behavior analysis, behavior is maintained by one (or more) of four functions:

1. **Escape/Avoidance** — The behavior allows the student to avoid or delay something aversive (a difficult task, a non-preferred activity, a social interaction)
2. **Attention** — The behavior produces social attention from adults or peers (even negative attention counts)
3. **Access to Tangibles** — The behavior results in access to a preferred item or activity
4. **Automatic/Sensory** — The behavior itself is reinforcing (sensory stimulation, pain reduction)

### Writing the Hypothesis Statement

Your hypothesis statement should follow this format:

> **When** [antecedent/setting event], **[student]** engages in **[target behavior]** in order to **[function: obtain/escape]** **[specific reinforcer]**.

**Example:** "When presented with grade-level reading tasks during ELA instruction, Marcus engages in verbal refusal (saying 'no,' 'I can't,' or 'this is stupid') and puts his head on his desk in order to escape the academic demand. This behavior is more likely on days following poor sleep (fewer than 7 hours reported by parent)."

A strong hypothesis:
- Is testable
- Accounts for setting events
- Specifies the function
- Is supported by converging data from multiple sources

## Step 5: Write the FBA Report

Your FBA report should be a clear, professional document that any team member can understand. Here's a recommended structure:

### FBA Report Template

1. **Student Information** — Name, grade, school, date, referral reason
2. **Behavior Description** — Operational definitions of all target behaviors
3. **Assessment Methods** — List all indirect and direct methods used
4. **Setting Events and Antecedents** — Summary of triggers and contextual factors
5. **Consequences** — What maintains the behavior
6. **Data Summary** — Charts, graphs, and narrative of patterns observed
7. **Hypothesis Statement(s)** — Function-based hypothesis for each target behavior
8. **Recommendations** — Broad intervention directions linked to function

### Common FBA Mistakes to Avoid

- **Skipping indirect assessment.** Don't rely on observation alone — you'll miss setting events and history
- **Vague operational definitions.** If you can't measure it, you can't assess it
- **Confirmation bias.** Don't decide the function before you collect data
- **Single-source data.** Triangulate across interviews, observations, and records
- **Not linking to intervention.** An FBA without a clear path to a BIP is incomplete

## Step 6: From FBA to BIP

The whole point of an FBA is to inform intervention. Your hypothesis statement should map directly onto your behavior intervention plan.

| FBA Finding | BIP Component |
|-------------|---------------|
| Antecedent triggers | Antecedent modifications (prevention strategies) |
| Function of behavior | Replacement behavior that serves the same function |
| Maintaining consequences | Modified consequences (reinforce replacement, don't reinforce problem behavior) |
| Setting events | Setting event strategies (check-in, schedule modifications) |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long should an FBA take?

A thorough FBA typically takes several weeks from referral to completed report. This allows time for multiple observations, interviews with key stakeholders, and careful data analysis. Rushing the process leads to inaccurate hypotheses and ineffective interventions.

### Who can conduct an FBA?

Requirements vary by state, but generally a BCBA, school psychologist, or other qualified behavior specialist should lead the FBA process. Teachers and paraprofessionals can assist with data collection under supervision.

### Can I use the same FBA template for every student?

You should use a consistent process, but the specific methods and focus areas will vary based on the student's age, the behavior of concern, and the school setting. A cookie-cutter approach misses the individualization that makes FBAs effective.

### What if the behavior has multiple functions?

It's common for behavior to serve more than one function, or for different topographies to serve different functions. In these cases, write a separate hypothesis for each function and ensure your BIP addresses all identified functions.

## Next Steps

A well-written FBA is the foundation of everything that follows — the BIP, the IEP goals, the progress monitoring, and ultimately the student's success. Take the time to do it right.
