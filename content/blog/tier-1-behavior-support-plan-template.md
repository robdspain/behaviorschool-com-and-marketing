*Edited by Rob Spain, BCBA, IBA*

Not every student needs an individual behavior plan. In fact, most do not. About 80% of students in a well-functioning PBIS school respond to Tier 1 universal supports alone.

But here is the catch: Tier 1 supports only work if they are consistent, clearly defined, and systematically implemented. A vague "be respectful" poster on the wall is not Tier 1. A structured system with clear expectations, teaching routines, and consistent reinforcement is.

This guide provides a Tier 1 behavior support plan template, explains what belongs at Tier 1 vs Tier 2, and gives you ready-to-use examples for classroom-wide implementation.

## What Is Tier 1 in PBIS/MTSS?

Tier 1 represents **universal supports provided to all students** in a classroom, grade level, or school.

**Key features of Tier 1:**
- Preventative (designed to stop problems before they start)
- Applies to everyone (not individualized)
- Evidence-based (grounded in behavioral principles)
- Data-informed (you track implementation and outcomes)

**Examples of Tier 1 supports:**
- School-wide or classroom expectations (clearly taught and reinforced)
- Consistent routines and schedules
- Positive reinforcement systems (praise, token economies, group rewards)
- Visual supports (schedules, cues, reminders)
- Active supervision and engagement strategies
- Social-emotional learning (SEL) curriculum

## Tier 1 vs Tier 2 vs Tier 3: When to Use Each

| Tier | For Whom | Intensity | Individualization | Example |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| **Tier 1** | All students (~80%) | Universal | None (applies to everyone) | Classroom-wide token economy |
| **Tier 2** | Some students (~15%) | Targeted | Small group or simple individual plan | Check-in/Check-out (CICO) |
| **Tier 3** | Few students (~5%) | Intensive | Fully individualized, function-based | FBA-based BIP for aggression |

If a student is not responding to Tier 1, you move to Tier 2. If Tier 2 is not enough, you move to Tier 3 (which typically requires an FBA).

The goal is to provide the least intensive support necessary for success.

## Components of a Tier 1 Behavior Support Plan

A strong Tier 1 plan includes the following components:

### 1. Clearly Defined Expectations

**What it is:** 3-5 positively stated behavioral expectations that apply across all settings.

**Example:**
- Be respectful
- Be responsible
- Be safe
- Be kind

**How to make it work:**
- Define what each expectation looks like in observable terms (a behavior matrix)
- Teach the expectations explicitly (model, practice, review)
- Post visual reminders in every classroom

**Sample Behavior Matrix:**

| Expectation | Classroom | Hallway | Cafeteria | Playground |
|-------------|-----------|---------|-----------|------------|
| Be Respectful | Listen when others speak | Use quiet voices | Clean up after yourself | Include others in games |
| Be Responsible | Bring materials to class | Walk on the right | Follow lunch procedures | Return equipment |
| Be Safe | Keep hands to self | Walk, don't run | Stay seated while eating | Use equipment correctly |

### 2. Teaching Routines

**What it is:** Explicit instruction in how to follow expectations.

**How to teach expectations:**
- **Model:** Show students what the behavior looks like
- **Practice:** Have students rehearse the behavior
- **Reinforce:** Praise students when they demonstrate the behavior
- **Review:** Reteach after breaks (weekends, holidays, after incidents)

**Example lesson plan:**
- Objective: Students will line up quietly and walk to the cafeteria following school expectations
- Model: Teacher demonstrates lining up, walking quietly, staying in line
- Practice: Students practice lining up while teacher provides feedback
- Reinforce: Teacher praises students who follow the routine
- Review: Reteach the routine every Monday morning for the first 3 weeks of school

### 3. Positive Reinforcement System

**What it is:** A system for acknowledging and rewarding students who meet expectations.

**Examples:**
- Verbal praise ("I love how you raised your hand!")
- Tangible tokens (tickets, points, stickers)
- Class-wide rewards (extra recess, movie day, popcorn party when the class earns 100 tickets)
- Individual recognition (student of the week, shout-outs)

**Key principle:** Reinforcement should outnumber corrections by at least 4:1 (ideally 5:1 or higher).

**Example token economy:**
- Students earn "Cougar Cash" for demonstrating expectations
- Cash can be exchanged for privileges (lunch with teacher, homework pass, free time)
- Class-wide goal: Earn 500 Cougar Cash by Friday for a class celebration

### 4. Consistent Responses to Problem Behavior

**What it is:** A clear, predictable system for addressing minor misbehavior.

**Tier 1 responses to minor behavior:**
- Proximity (move closer to the student)
- Non-verbal cues (eye contact, gesture, point to expectation poster)
- Verbal reminder ("Remember, we walk in the hallway")
- Redirect to the expected behavior ("Show me what respectful looks like")

**When to escalate beyond Tier 1:**
- Behavior is chronic (happening daily despite Tier 1 supports)
- Behavior is dangerous (aggression, elopement, self-injury)
- Behavior significantly disrupts learning

### 5. Data Collection and Progress Monitoring

**What it is:** Tracking implementation fidelity and student outcomes.

**What to track:**
- Office discipline referrals (ODRs) per month
- Number of students earning rewards
- Teacher implementation fidelity (are expectations being taught and reinforced consistently?)

**Example data dashboard:**
- September: 45 ODRs, 60% of students earned class reward
- October: 32 ODRs, 75% of students earned class reward
- November: 28 ODRs, 80% of students earned class reward

If ODRs are not decreasing or rewards are not being earned, revisit your Tier 1 implementation.

### 6. Family and Community Engagement

**What it is:** Involving families in supporting school-wide expectations.

**Examples:**
- Send home expectation posters or bookmarks
- Teach parents the same expectations at back-to-school night
- Recognize students who demonstrate expectations at home (parent nomination)
- Include expectations in school newsletters

## Example Tier 1 Scenario: 3rd Grade Classroom

**Context:** Ms. Garcia's 3rd grade class has 24 students. Minor disruptions (talking out, off-task behavior) are frequent. She wants a structured Tier 1 plan.

**Expectations:**
1. Be Respectful
2. Be Responsible
3. Be Ready to Learn

**Teaching Plan:**
- First week of school: 15-minute lesson each day on one expectation
- Role-play scenarios (what does "be ready to learn" look like during independent work?)
- Visual posters at each learning center

**Reinforcement System:**
- Students earn "Star Bucks" (paper stars) for demonstrating expectations
- Individual reward: 10 Star Bucks = choose a prize from treasure box
- Class reward: 200 Star Bucks = extra recess on Friday

**Responses to Minor Behavior:**
1. Non-verbal cue (point to expectation poster)
2. Proximity (move closer to student)
3. Verbal reminder ("Show me what 'ready to learn' looks like")
4. If behavior continues: brief 1:1 check-in ("What expectation are we working on? How can I help?")

**Data:**
- Track number of Star Bucks earned per week
- Track number of times each student redirected (if >5 redirects per week, consider Tier 2)

**Family Engagement:**
- Send home Star Bucks system explanation at back-to-school night
- Weekly newsletter highlights students who demonstrated expectations

**Outcome after 6 weeks:**
- 90% of students earning rewards weekly
- Off-task behavior reduced by 60% (based on teacher tracking)
- 2 students not responding (moved to Tier 2 check-in system)

## Common Tier 1 Mistakes

### 1. Expectations Are Too Vague

❌ "Be good"
✅ "Keep hands, feet, and objects to yourself"

### 2. Expectations Are Not Taught

Posting expectations on the wall is not teaching. Students need explicit instruction, modeling, and practice.

### 3. Inconsistent Reinforcement

If only one teacher is using the reinforcement system, it will not work. All staff in the setting must implement consistently.

### 4. Too Focused on Punishment

Tier 1 is about preventing problems and reinforcing desired behavior. If your plan is 90% consequences and 10% reinforcement, it is not Tier 1.

### 5. No Data Collection

You cannot improve what you do not measure. Track something (ODRs, reward participation, teacher observations) to know if Tier 1 is working.

## When to Move Beyond Tier 1

Tier 1 is not enough if:

- A student is consistently not responding (getting redirected daily despite supports)
- Behavior is escalating in frequency or intensity
- Behavior poses a safety risk
- Student requires more individualized support to be successful

At that point, move to [Tier 2 targeted supports](/blog/tier-2-behavior-support-plan-template) or, if needed, a full FBA and Tier 3 plan.

## How BehaviorSchool Can Help

If you need help building Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3 behavior plans, the [BehaviorSchool Behavior Plans tool](/behavior-plans) provides templates, examples, and customization options for all three tiers.

For students who need Tier 3 support, use the [FBA-to-BIP tool](/fba-to-bip) to create function-based, legally defensible plans in minutes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Tier 1 the same as PBIS?

PBIS (Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports) is a framework that includes Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3. Tier 1 is the universal foundation of PBIS.

### Can I have a Tier 1 plan for just my classroom, or does it need to be school-wide?

Both work. School-wide Tier 1 is ideal (consistent expectations across all settings), but a strong classroom Tier 1 plan is better than no plan at all.

### How long should I try Tier 1 before moving a student to Tier 2?

Give Tier 1 at least 4-6 weeks of consistent implementation. If a student is not responding after 6 weeks, consider Tier 2. If behavior is dangerous, do not wait, move to Tier 2 or Tier 3 immediately.

### Do students with IEPs still receive Tier 1 supports?

Yes. Tier 1 is universal. All students, including those with IEPs, benefit from clear expectations and positive reinforcement. Students with IEPs may also receive Tier 2 or Tier 3 supports in addition to Tier 1.

### How do I get teachers to buy in to Tier 1?

Show them the data. Schools with strong Tier 1 systems have fewer ODRs, less time spent on behavior management, and more time for instruction. Provide training, coaching, and regular feedback to support implementation.
