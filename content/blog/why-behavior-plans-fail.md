Behavior plans fail far more often because of implementation breakdown than because of bad assessment. That’s not a moral judgment on staff—it’s a predictable result of how human behavior works under stress, time pressure, and competing contingencies.

Research across school consultation and organizational behavior management is clear: **without performance feedback, training alone does not maintain implementation**. And without administrative alignment, even good training doesn’t stick. When a plan fails, the first question should be: **“Is this an intervention problem—or an implementation problem?”**

Below is a concise, evidence-based framework for diagnosing *why* plans break and what actually fixes it.

---

## The Real Failure Point: Implementation Integrity
**The most robust finding in the literature:** Treatment integrity drops quickly without follow‑up support. Teacher self‑report is not a reliable indicator of fidelity. Consultation without feedback leads to rapid drift, even when training is excellent.

**What works:** **Ongoing performance feedback**—brief, data‑based, and tied to both staff behavior *and* student outcomes—reliably improves implementation (Noell et al., 2002; Codding et al., 2005).

> **Bottom line:** The training event is not the intervention. The feedback loop is the intervention.

## Why Staff Default to Punishment (Even When They Don’t Want To)
Punishment works *immediately*—it stops behavior right now. Reinforcement is slower and more complex. Under stress, humans choose the contingency that feels effective in the moment.

The problem isn’t that staff are “punitive.” It’s that **punishment is the most powerful immediate reinforcer for adult behavior** when a classroom is chaotic. If we don’t design for that reality, implementation will drift.

**Key failure point:** extinction bursts. When behavior gets worse before it gets better, staff often interpret that as plan failure and “cave,” which then *intermittently* reinforces the problem behavior—making it more resistant long‑term.

---

## The Coercive Cycle: Staff Behavior Is Also Being Conditioned
Patterson’s coercive cycle applies in schools: staff withdraw demands to escape escalation, and both the teacher’s behavior and the student’s behavior get reinforced by relief. This doesn’t mean teachers are wrong or bad—it means they’re human.

**Translation:** If a plan doesn’t address the *aversive conditions teachers experience while implementing it*, it will fail.

---

## The “Velcro Aide” Problem: Escalation to Keep Support
Giangreco’s research on paraprofessional proximity shows how RBT or aide presence can inadvertently maintain dependency. When RBTs are deployed primarily during crises, staff may (often unintentionally) behave in ways that keep the “need” high because extra adult support is reinforcing.

**System fix:** decouple RBT schedules from crisis-only response and create **pre‑scheduled, proactive support**. This changes the contingency maintaining escalation.

---

## Why Validation Alone Doesn’t Work
Validation is humane, but it is not a behavior change strategy by itself. Research on consultation and implementation shows that **performance feedback with data** is what changes behavior. Validation can open the door—but **the data loop is what sustains implementation**.

---

## Partial Implementation Can Be Worse Than None
When staff implement only part of a plan—especially in a reinforcement + extinction procedure—it can create intermittent reinforcement. That is the most durable reinforcement schedule we know. In practice, partial implementation often makes behavior **more resistant**.

**Takeaway:** Either we build full fidelity with support, or we simplify until full fidelity is realistic.

# What Actually Works (Evidence‑Ranked)

### 1) **Performance Feedback with Data (Highest Evidence)**
Brief, weekly feedback that shows:
- **Staff behavior** (implementation steps)
- **Student outcomes** (graphs, simple visuals)

This dramatically improves fidelity and outcomes (Noell et al., 2002; Codding et al., 2005).

### 2) **Behavioral Skills Training (BST)**
Instruction → Modeling → Rehearsal → Feedback  
One training meeting is *not* training. BST is the gold standard (Parsons et al., 2012; Sarokoff & Sturmey, 2004).

### 3) **Implementation Planning**
Co‑authored plans that specify **who does what by when**, and **what to do when it breaks** outperform standard consultation (Iovannone et al., 2015).

### 4) **Admin Alignment First**
No administrator buy‑in = no accountability structure = no sustained implementation. Administrative alignment is a **predictor of plan survival**, not a “nice to have.”

### 5) **Functional Assessment of Staff Behavior**
Ask: **What is maintaining the staff non‑compliance?**  
Design an intervention for *that* behavior (escape, avoidance, access to help, etc.).

# When Staff Openly Refuse the Plan
This is where **Motivational Interviewing (MI)** is most useful. The best evidence-supported stance is to **roll with resistance**, identify the specific concern, and find a point of agreement.

Common objections:
- “This feels like bribery” → clarify **contingency vs. bribery**
- “It won’t work” → show **baseline + similar case data**
- “It takes too much time” → **simplify** or **BST for fluency**

If refusal persists and student wellbeing is impacted, it becomes an administrative issue—not a clinical one.

---

# Where ACT and OBM Fit
**ACT** helps address the *values and belief barriers* that skill training won’t touch.  
**OBM** provides the feedback systems and reinforcement architecture that sustain staff behavior change.

In other words:
- **ACT** helps with “I don’t believe this will work.”
- **OBM** helps with “I know what to do but I stopped doing it.”

# A Simple Implementation Checklist (Quick Reference)

**Before rollout**
- Admin alignment confirmed
- Staff belief barriers addressed
- Plan simplified to essential steps
- Implementation plan co‑authored

**During rollout**
- BST in the natural environment
- Performance feedback weekly
- Graph staff behavior + student outcomes together

**If it breaks**
- Identify function of staff non‑compliance
- Adjust contingencies, don’t just repeat training
- Escalate to admin if refusal persists

---

# Conclusion
Behavior plans fail not because schools are broken—but because we often design plans as if *only the student’s behavior matters*. In reality, **teacher behavior, administrator contingencies, and system reinforcement** determine whether even the best plan survives.

If we treat staff behavior as part of the system and design for it—using BST, feedback loops, and admin alignment—behavior plans start working the way we expected them to in the first place.
