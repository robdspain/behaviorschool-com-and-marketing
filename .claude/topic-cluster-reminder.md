# Topic Cluster Development Reminder

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Use Topic Clusters for All New SEO Pages

**Location:** `/TOPIC_CLUSTERS_STRATEGY.md`

### Before Creating Any New Landing Pages:

1. **Check the cluster document** - Every new page MUST fit into one of the 6 defined clusters
2. **Follow the user journey** - Ensure the page supports the intended conversion path
3. **Plan internal linking** - Connect to hub pages and related cluster content
4. **Use proper breadcrumbs** - Home > Hub > Current Page structure

### 6 Topic Clusters Defined:

1. **BCBA Exam Preparation** (Hub: `/behavior-study-tools`)
2. **School-Based BCBA Practice** (Hub: `/school-based-bcba`) 
3. **IEP Goals & Documentation** (Hub: `/iep-goals`)
4. **Behavior Intervention Plans** (Hub: `/behavior-plans`)
5. **BCBA Supervision & Professional Development** (Hub: `/supervisors`)
6. **Applied Behavior Analysis in Education** (Hub: `/community`)
