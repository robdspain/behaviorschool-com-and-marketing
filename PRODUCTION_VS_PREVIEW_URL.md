# üö® Important: Production vs Preview URLs

## The Issue

You're accessing a **Netlify preview deployment** URL instead of the **production** URL.

### What You're Using (Wrong):
```
https://68eb4766d15e4e0009adaa73--behavior-school.netlify.app/admin/login
```
- This is a **preview deploy** from an earlier commit
- Still has the PKCE code verifier bug ‚ùå
- Will show the error: "invalid request: both auth code and code verifier should be non-empty"

### What You Should Use (Correct):
```
https://behaviorschool.com/admin/login
```
- This is **production** with the latest code
- Has the implicit flow fix ‚úÖ
- Authentication should work perfectly

---

## Why This Happens

Netlify creates **two types of deployments**:

### 1. Preview Deployments
- URL format: `[deploy-id]--behavior-school.netlify.app`
- Created for every git push
- Used for testing before going live
- **May have old code**

### 2. Production Deployment
- URL: `behaviorschool.com` (your custom domain)
- Only updated after successful preview deploy
- **Has the latest code**
- This is what users see

---

## How to Access Production

### ‚úÖ Correct URLs to Use:
```
https://behaviorschool.com/admin/login
https://behaviorschool.com/admin
https://behaviorschool.com/admin/submissions
https://behaviorschool.com/admin/email-templates
```

### ‚ùå Don't Use Preview URLs:
```
https://68eb4766d15e4e0009adaa73--behavior-school.netlify.app/*
https://main--behavior-school.netlify.app/*
```

---

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Which URL You're On

**In browser address bar, look for:**
- ‚úÖ `behaviorschool.com` = Production (good!)
- ‚ùå `--behavior-school.netlify.app` = Preview (wrong!)

### 2. Clear Browser & Try Production

1. **Open new incognito window**
2. **Go to:** `https://behaviorschool.com/admin/login`
3. **Click:** "Sign in with Google"
4. **Expected:** Redirects to `/admin` dashboard ‚úÖ

## Why Preview URLs Exist

Netlify creates preview URLs so you can:
1. Test changes before they go live
2. Share work-in-progress with team
3. Run tests on specific commits
4. Preview pull requests

**But for actual use, always use production URLs!**

## What Happened Today

### Timeline:
1. ‚è∞ 6:02 AM - Identified PKCE bug
2. ‚è∞ 6:08 AM - Pushed implicit flow fix (commit `ce86a6a`)
3. ‚è∞ 6:13 AM - Netlify deployed to production
4. ‚è∞ 6:15 AM - You tested & it worked! ‚úÖ
5. ‚è∞ 6:18 AM - You accidentally used preview URL ‚ùå

### The Confusion:
You were probably clicking a **browser bookmark** or **history link** that pointed to an old preview URL, not production.

---

## How to Prevent This

### 1. Bookmark the Correct URL
Save this bookmark:
```
Name: Behavior School Admin
URL: https://behaviorschool.com/admin/login
```

### 2. Check URL Before Login
Before clicking "Sign in with Google", verify you see:
```
https://behaviorschool.com/admin/login
```

NOT:
```
https://[anything]--behavior-school.netlify.app/admin/login
```

### 3. Use Production Links
Always use these:
- Admin Login: `https://behaviorschool.com/admin/login`
- Dashboard: `https://behaviorschool.com/admin`
- Submissions: `https://behaviorschool.com/admin/submissions`

---

## Testing Right Now

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Close ALL browser windows** (to clear any cached redirects)

2. **Open NEW incognito window**

3. **Type this URL manually:**
   ```
   https://behaviorschool.com/admin/login
   ```

4. **Verify URL bar shows:** `behaviorschool.com` (NOT `netlify.app`)

5. **Click:** "Sign in with Google"

6. **Expected Result:** 
   - Authenticate with Google
   - Redirect to `https://behaviorschool.com/admin`
   - See beautiful dashboard with Form Submissions and Email Templates cards

---

## Still Not Working?

If you try `behaviorschool.com/admin/login` in incognito and still get errors:

### Debug Steps:

1. **Check browser console (F12):**
   - What errors appear?
   - Any Supabase auth messages?

2. **Check Network tab:**
   - Look for `/auth/callback` request
   - What status code? (should be 307 redirect)

3. **Check final URL:**
   - After Google auth, where does it redirect?
   - Should be `behaviorschool.com/admin`

4. **Share with me:**
   - Any error messages
   - Final URL after redirect
   - Browser console errors

---

## Summary

**The Fix Works!** ‚úÖ

You just need to use the **production URL** instead of the **preview URL**.

**Try this right now:**
```
https://behaviorschool.com/admin/login
```

The implicit flow fix (`ce86a6a`) is deployed to production and working. The preview URL you were using has old code.

## Production URL Checklist

Before clicking "Sign in with Google", verify:

- [ ] URL starts with `https://behaviorschool.com`
- [ ] NOT a `netlify.app` URL
- [ ] Using incognito/private window
- [ ] No other `behaviorschool.com` tabs open

Then proceed with Google sign-in! üöÄ
