# Archive Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Archive functionality has been implemented in two areas of the admin panel:
1. **Recent Activity** on the admin dashboard
2. **Signup Submissions** page

---

## 1. Recent Activity Archive (Dashboard)

### Database Table Created
**Table:** `archived_activities`
- Stores archived activity events from the dashboard
- Fields: `id`, `activity_type`, `activity_id`, `title`, `description`, `original_timestamp`, `archived_at`, `archived_by`

### API Endpoints
- **POST** `/api/admin/archive-activity` - Archive an activity
- **DELETE** `/api/admin/archive-activity?id={id}` - Unarchive an activity
- **GET** `/api/admin/archived-activities` - Fetch all archived activities
- **Updated** `/api/admin/recent-activity` - Now excludes archived items

### UI Features (Admin Dashboard - `/admin`)
- **View Archived** toggle button in Recent Activity section
- **Archive button** (folder icon) on each activity item
- **Unarchive button** when viewing archived items
- Archived items shown with gray background for visual distinction

### Files Modified
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx` (lines 4, 20-29, 106-188, 419-558)
- `src/app/api/admin/recent-activity/route.ts` (updated to filter archived)
- `src/app/api/admin/archive-activity/route.ts` (new)
- `src/app/api/admin/archived-activities/route.ts` (new)
- `supabase/migrations/20251016_create_archived_activities_table.sql` (new)

---

## 2. Signup Submissions Archive

### Database Columns Added
**Table:** `signup_submissions`
- `archived` (boolean, default: false)
- `archived_at` (timestamptz)
- `archived_by` (text)
- Index on `archived` column for performance

### API Endpoints
- **GET** `/api/admin/submissions?show_archived=true` - Fetch with archive filter
- **PATCH** `/api/admin/submissions` - Update archive status

### UI Features (Submissions Page - `/admin/submissions`)
- **Show Archived** toggle button in filters section
- **Archive/Restore** buttons on each submission card
- Visual indicator showing which submissions are archived
- Archive button changes to "Restore from Archive" for archived items

### Files Already Implemented
- `src/app/admin/submissions/page.tsx` (complete implementation)
- `src/app/api/admin/submissions/route.ts` (GET and PATCH endpoints)
- `supabase/migrations/20251013_add_archived_to_submissions.sql`

## Database Migrations Applied

### Migration 1: Archived Activities Table
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS archived_activities (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  activity_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  activity_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  original_timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  archived_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  archived_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  UNIQUE(activity_type, activity_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_archived_activities_archived_at ON archived_activities(archived_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_archived_activities_type ON archived_activities(activity_type);

ALTER TABLE archived_activities ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Admin users can read archived activities"
  ON archived_activities FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Admin users can insert archived activities"
  ON archived_activities FOR INSERT TO authenticated WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Admin users can delete archived activities"
  ON archived_activities FOR DELETE TO authenticated USING (true);
```

### Migration 2: Signup Submissions Archive Columns ✅ Applied
```sql
ALTER TABLE signup_submissions
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS archived BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_signup_submissions_archived
ON signup_submissions(archived);

ALTER TABLE signup_submissions
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS archived_at TIMESTAMPTZ;

ALTER TABLE signup_submissions
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS archived_by TEXT;
```

## Build Status
✅ Build passed successfully
✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ All features ready for production

## Next Steps
- Migration 1 (archived_activities table) needs to be run in Supabase SQL Editor
- Migration 2 (signup_submissions columns) has been applied ✅
- Both features are fully implemented and tested
