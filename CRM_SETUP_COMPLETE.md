## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Database Tables

You need to run the SQL in `supabase-crm-setup.sql`:

**Option A: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dugolglucuzolzvuqxmi/editor
2. Click "New Query" or SQL Editor
3. Copy ALL contents from `supabase-crm-setup.sql`
4. Paste and click "Run"
5. Wait for success message

**What this does:**
- Creates 6 CRM tables
- Sets up indexes for performance
- Enables Row Level Security
- Creates views for reporting
- **Migrates existing signups** from `signup_submissions` to `crm_contacts`

### Step 2: Access the CRM

1. Go to: https://behaviorschool.com/admin
2. Click the green "CRM System" card
3. Start managing your contacts!

## 📊 How It Works

### Data Flow

```
1. User submits signup form
   ↓
2. Saved to signup_submissions (existing)
   ↓
3. Automatically synced to crm_contacts
   ↓
4. Appears in CRM dashboard
   ↓
5. You manage through sales pipeline
   ↓
6. Track activities, tasks, and deals
```

### Current Integration

- **Existing signup_submissions** → Automatically imported as CRM contacts
- All your current signups are already CRM contacts (after you run the SQL)
- Future signups can be manually or automatically added

## 💡 How to Use

### Your Daily Workflow

2. **After Onboarding Call:**
   - Go to `/admin/crm/contacts`
   - Find the contact
   - Update status to "qualified"
   - Add notes about the call
   - Create follow-up task
   - Add to checkout access if ready to buy

3. **Sales Pipeline:**
   - Move contacts through stages
   - Track deal values
   - Set expected close dates

4. **Follow-ups:**

### Example: Converting a Lead

```
1. New signup arrives → Status: "lead"
2. You call them → Log activity, Status: "contacted"
3. They're interested → Create deal, Status: "qualified"
4. Schedule demo → Add task, Status: "onboarding"
5. They pay → Update deal, Status: "customer"
```

## 🔐 Security

- All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Only service role can access (your admin panel)
- Soft deletes (contacts archived, not deleted)
- Audit trail through created_at/updated_at

## 📈 Reporting Views

Two SQL views created for easy reporting:

1. **crm_pipeline_summary** - Deal breakdown by stage
2. **crm_contact_activity_summary** - Contact engagement metrics

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Run the SQL** (supabase-crm-setup.sql)
2. **Visit** `/admin/crm`
3. **Review** your imported contacts
4. **Start** managing your pipeline!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"No contacts showing"**
- Make sure SQL ran successfully
- Check that tables were created
- Verify data migration happened

**"Can't create contact"**
- Check Supabase connection
- Verify API routes are working
- Check browser console for errors
